## Introduction

1.1 Introduced new items into the games called toolkits. These toolkits perform the duel purpose of being a mechanic for accessing crafting from the inventory by using the item, and a filter for the crafting when using the crafting work stations or player crafting.

It also saw the reintroduction of player crafting which means that you can use multiple workstations while in proximity to them, without having to try to remove a NPC.
