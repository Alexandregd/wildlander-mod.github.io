Both Armor and weapons within wildlander make tempering your equipment relevant.

The higher the temper on the weapon, the more damage it does. 
The higher the temper on the Armor, the more protection it does. 

Tempering is shown in your inventory with a Word description and a number in brackets.

You can temper/repair your own weapons with your smithing skills at the grindstone, and armor at the armor workbench. You can also ask the blacksmiths to “upgrade your equipment”. In order to repair your damaged weapons and armor back to “standard” temper, you need to have the perk for the material the piece is made from and sufficient skill in smithing.

Iequip icons on your UI give a visual repesentation of how close your weapon is to dropping a temper tier.

## Degrade Rules 

* On hit a random piece of armor is degraded.
* Shields only degrade when blocking
* Weapons degrade on contact with anything (not just enemies).
* Daedric Artifact do not degrade.
* The better the materiel the slower it degrades
* Durability loss for weapons is calulated by the base Weapon hit 0.2% or power attack hit of 3% multiplied by the Weapon materiel table below.
* Durability loss for armor is calulated by the Armor type Multiplied by 0.2% Weapon hit multiplied by the Armor materiel table below.

E.g Hide cuiass

* 1(light armor) * 2.5(Animal Hide)  * 0.2% = 0.5% Durability loss per standard attack

E.g Orcish Weapon

* 1.3(Orcish)  * 0.2% = 0.26% Durability loss per standard attack
* 1.3(Orcish)  * 3%   = 3.9% Durability loss per Power attack
