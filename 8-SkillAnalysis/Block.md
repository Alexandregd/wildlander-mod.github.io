# Mechanics

In Skyrim, you block a flat amount of damage with no skill, and this baseline amount of damage blocked is improved by your skill level and respective perks in the block tree. The Higher your Skill and perks, the more damage is stopped. It should be noted that it is impossible the block all damage via blocking and armor, as like all other of resistance, Armor is capped. 

Holding your shield or weapon up to block a attack will inflict a stamina drain. Without perks, if your stamina drops below 20, this inflicts a penalty on your blocking skill, reducing the amount of damage you negate to 2%. therefore it is Essential that you keep your stamina high, and only block when needed.
