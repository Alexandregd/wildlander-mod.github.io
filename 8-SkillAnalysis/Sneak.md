# --Mechanics --

Unperked your odds of being detected are tripled, and therefore you are guarenteed to be detected. 

Wearing Heavy armor is the equivalent of trying to sneak up on someone while dragging a sack of cans behind you - Noisy and not going to happen.

## Sleeping Targets

You deal 100x more damage to a sleeping target.

## Sneak Attack Immune

Some endgame creatures in Requiem are immune to sneak attacks, while you will still have 'sneak attack was successful' notification, you will only deal normal damage.

Here is a list of creatures which are immune.

* Storm Atronach
* Flame Atronach
* Frost Atronach
* Ash Guardians
* Ash Spawn
* Death Hounds
* Everything found in Soul Cairn
* Dragon Priests
* Dwarven Centurions
* Dwarven Spiders
* Dwarven Spheres
* Ice Wraiths
* All variants of Draugr 
* All variants of Skeletons
* All variants of Spriggans
* Wisps & their mothers

Notice almost all of these creatures are either undead, mechanical or otherwise lacking in physical organs.

## Mastery Branch

This branch improves your sneaking ability and grants you additional stealth capabilities.

---

**Stealth**

Your sneaking ability is 15/35% more effective. Heavy armor nullifies this bonus.

Level Required : 0/20

Perk Required : None/Stealth (Rank I)

_Effects_:

Rank 1: Removes the penalty for sneaking, and adjusts your skill to behave as if you had 15 extra points in it.

Rank 2: Adjusts your skill to behave as if you had 35 extra points in it.

Note: Removes the penalty even if you are wearing heavy armor, but the increased odds to not become detected only apply if you are not wearing heavy armor. Higher ranks overwrite the lower ones.

---

**Muffled Movement**

Your newfound finesse allows you to move 15% more quietly, provided you are not wearing any heavy armor.

Level Required : 25

Perk Required : Stealth (Rank I)

_Effects_:

While not wearing any Heavy Armor, adjusts your skill to behave as if you had an extra 15 points in it. Stacks with similar effects.

Note: Does nothing to change your audible noise. 

---

**Light Steps**

Your careful movement prevents you from triggering pressure plates and other traps.

Level Required : 50

Perk Required : Muffled Movement

_Effects_:

You personally will not trigger any traps, however your followers still can.

---

**Acrobatics**

You can perform a silent forward roll to avoid most physical knockdowns. Your sneaking ability is 10% more effective. Heavy armor nullifies these effects.

Level Required : 75

Perk Required : Light Steps

_Note_: To perform the roll, tap the sprint key while sneaking.

_Effects_:

While not wearing Heavy Armor, adjusts your skill to behave as if you had an extra 10 points in it. Stacks with similar effects. Adds a passive roll that prevents you from being being knocked over by a lot of spells/abilities that would normally knock you over, see the list below. This makes fighting many creatures a lot more manageable. I believe an animation is played when Roll is triggered (needs verification).

Roll Triggering Abilities: Werewolf Howl, Shield Bash Disarm, Spell Impacts, Dragon Tail attacks, Mammoth Attacks, Giant Frostbite Spider attacks, certain unique Troll NPC attacks.

---

**Shadowrunner**

You are 15% harder to detect, your movement is 10% less audible, and you take 25% less damage from falling. Heavy armor nullifies these bonuses. 

Level Required : 100

Perk Required : Acrobatics

_Effects_:

While not wearing Heavy Armor, decreases your overall chance to be detected by 10%, adds another bonus to your Sneak skill as if you had an extra 10 points in it, and reduces fall damage by 25%.

---

## Sneak Attack Branch

This branch makes your sneak attacks more effective.

---

**Deft Strike**

Sneak attacks with daggers, swords, or ranged weapons bypass 50% of the target's armor. 

Level Required : 25

Perk Required : Stealth (Rank I)

_Effects_:

Sneak attacks with Crossbows, Bows, Daggers, and Swords will gain 50% Armor penetration.

---

**Anatomical Lore**

Your knowledge of vital organs improves sneak attacks against men and mer. Melee strikes against humanoids deal 5x damage, while ranged attacks are 2x stronger.

Level Required : 50

Perk Required : Deft Strike

_Effects_:

Against humanoid targets, Crossbows and Bows will deal 200% more damage in sneak attacks, while everything else will deal 500% more damage.

---

**Advanced Anatomical Lore**

Your knowledge of anatomy allows you to perform devastating sneak attacks on almost any target. Melee strikes against non-immune creatures deal 5x damage, and ranged attacks are 2x stronger.

Level Required : 50

Perk Required : Anatomical Lore

_Effects_:

Against all targets, Crossbows and Bows will deal 200% more damage in sneak attacks, while everything else will deal 500% more damage.

Note: This overwrites the previous perk Anatomical Lore, an odd behavior considering most perks in requiem only normally do that when they are ranks in the same perk.
