### This page is a WIP

# Barbarian

# Description
This class revolves around the [Evasion](..\8-skillAnalysis\Evasion.html) and [Two-Handed](..\8-skillAnalysis\Two-Handed) skills in order to dodge attacks and deliver heavy blows. As this build is a bit more risky than other Warrior-archetype builds, I would recommend a build such as the Knight (to be added) for newer players.

#Skills 

## Starting Skills
- [Two-handed](..\8-skillAnalysis\Two-handed.html)
- [Evasion](..\8-skillAnalysis\Evasion.html) 
- [Block](..\8-skillAnalysis\Block.html) 
- [Smithing](..\8-skillAnalysis\Smithing.html) 
- [Archery](..\8-skillAnalysis\Archery.html) 
- [Alchemy](..\8-skillAnalysis\Alchemy.html) (optional)
- [Speech](..\8-skillAnalysis\Speech.html) (optional)

{: .note}
**Note:** Alchemy is.....a bit broken. While it is possible to play an alchemy character without breaking the game, in its current state it is easy to even unintentionally become extremely strong very quickly via Alchemy. If you want to have a more challenging experience, I would recommend opting for Speech over Alchemy.

## Secondary Skills


# Perks


# Recommended Weapons / Spells


# Recommended Armor / Clothing
- The Savior's Hide is a fantastic Daedric Artifact for this build, as it gives you some much-needed magic resistance along with several other benefits. Obtain it through the quest "Ill Met by Moonlight", started in the Falkreath graveyard (Make sure to kill Sinding).
- Other than that, the most effective light armor you can get your hands on.

# Strengths
- This build shines against nearly every melee opponent, especially if you have a variety of two-handed weapon types at your disposal. You should be able to dodge most melee adversaries, especially with effects such as Slow Time, which allows you to position yourself for a devastating counterattack.

# Weaknesses
- Archers, especially at close range. As this build doesn't contain [Illusion](..\8-skillAnalysis\Illusion.html) or [Heavy Armor](..\8-skillAnalysis\Heavy-Armor.html) and arrows are difficult to dodge, you should be careful when facing such enemies. Using a shout like Slow Time or the Combat Reflex [Evasion](..\8-skillAnalysis\Evasion.html) perk.
- Frost mages and mages that use AOE spells might prove challenging, which is why it is paramount to build up your magic resistance, and ideally, elemental resistances as quickly as possible. If you are really struggling with a group of mages, it could help to recruit a follower or two to drain your opponenets' magicka reserves and distract them.
