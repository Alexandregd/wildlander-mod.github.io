# The Necromancer

# Submitted By

Wulfdur

# Description

 A classic build, Necromancer. Breton is the cool race for this, but Altmer/Dunmer would work as well Ritual is the go-to stone.  Necromancer’s Amulet and Necromancer’s Robes are aimed for the looks. We would not do College quest line on this build for a change as the college frowns on necromancy, but instead clear other Necromancer spots for levels and RP. Vampire would go really well with this build, but it’s optional.
