## Introduction

### Mass of Equipped gear

Requiem has a complex for calculating penalties, the authors have dubbed it 'The Mass Effect' system, where higher weight typically means higher cost. They use a formula that is difficult to type out, if you have a decent understanding of math you can find it in the Requiem Manual. It affects mobility, spell casting and combat effectiveness. (Outdated-Requiem-Manual p122-133 Located in game-files\Mods\Requiem\Documentation)

#### Stamina Drain

Without having perks in Heavy Armor, you are penalized for wearing it at all and have your stamina drained.

#### Magic Cost

Spell costs in Requiem are based on your weight in a complex formula, you can read about it [here](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/03-YourFirstCharacter/Magic-Mechanics/#spell-costs).

In Summary - The Spell cost depends on the mass of of the equipment you are wearing. The heavier the equipment the more a spell will cost. Taking the casting perks for heavy armor, offset up to 51% of the penalties for the mass of your gear

#### Speed Modifiers

Without certain perks in Heavy Armor, you are penalized for wearing it and move slower.

#### Attack Speed Modifiers

Without certain perks in Heavy Armor, you are penalized for wearing it and attack slower.
