## Introduction

Illusion is a school of magic which affects the mind of either the target or the caster. It is the only school of magic with silent casting abilities for its spells.

Whenever an offensive illusion spell is cast, the game calculates a ”break-free chance” for the victim. There is more discussed on the Math behind this calculation within [Magic Mechanics](/06-MechanicsAnaylsis/Magic-Mechanics#resistance-versus-illusion-spells) but in summary - Illusion spells can fail.

### Upkeep
Several Illusion spells feature the upkeep mechanic. This means that you can keep a spell active for a small magic drain after casting. The proceed to cast further spells. Casting the spell again will cancel the spell and stop the magic drain.


### Hiding spells
Any illusion spell that contains either "muffle" and/or "invisibility" components is considered a hiding spell, which are all mutually exclusive. So yes, having Veil of Silence active and casting an invisibility spell will cancel the Veil of Silence.

Veil of Silence, Arcane Resonance and the Rune of Dampening are always cast without any noises NPCs could notice. So if necessary (as in "Intended by your play-style") you can cast Shadow Stride or simple Invisibility to move into position unseen near an NPC, hide behind a corner with no line of sight to the target, cast a silencing spell and then cast whatever harmful spell you intended to invoke on the unaware target.
