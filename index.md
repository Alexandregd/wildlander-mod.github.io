Wildlander is a total conversion modpack for _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition_ that aims to bring the frozen north into your home. Whether you want to call it immersion, realism, role-playing, or simple masochism, the end-goal is to make you actually feel like an intrepid adventurer climbing snow-covered mountains, delving into ancient ruins, and getting your bits bitten off by packs of hungry wolves.

Wildlander is made up of hundreds of publicly available mods made by almost as many talented mod authors. These mods have been carefully selected, tested, and tweaked by Dylan to iron out any technical difficulties and maintain a consistent experience.

Wildlander is also a mod in its own right as it includes proprietary features not available in the original included mods.

The whole experience is built around <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Requiem - the Roleplaying Overhaul <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a> - v5.0.3. Requiem completely retools all of Skyrim to create a challenging, deleveled world with plenty of meaningful choices.

In general, any Requiem resources you find online will be applicable to Wildlander. Some information may be outdated, overwritten by other mods in Wildlander, or disabled entirely, but the core principles remain the same. Assume that mechanics not covered in Wildlander's or Requiem's resources remain unchanged from the vanilla game.

Wildlander can be overwhelming at first, so I highly recommend reading up on it. Start with The Recommended reading section on this wiki and work down from there.

If videos are more your speed, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnVgWmZbuZxl2QFVapKjd3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam (Parz) <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a> has turned the wiki introduction into a video, which you can access clicking the image below.

### Save Advice

{: .important}
>
> When you load your save file, wait at least a minute before saving again. Some scripts will break if you save too soon after loading.
>
> Avoid saving during combat or other conditions of heavy script load.
>
> Never save more than once a minute.
>
> Never save within 30 seconds of entering a building / cell / dungeon.
>
> After waiting/sleeping, wait a minute to allow all the NPC's AI scripts to move to where they are supposed to be

### When starting a new character

{: .warning } 
> If you have played a character already and then exit to the main menu, do _not_ attempt to start a new character in the same session. Instead, quit entirely out of Skyrim and restart it from there. If you do not do so, the game will not operate properly and you will get errors such as 'please restart the economy' or 'Honed Metal has crashed.'
>
> This *isn't* a bug with the list. Skyrim does not handle you playing one character, returning to the menu, and then starting a second. This is because Skyrim doesn't unload all of the previous games scripts and can cause severe issues with your new play-through (hotkeys not working, broken economy, merchants with no gold, or your character leveling up when they shouldn't be).
>
> Every time you want to start a new character, you should be closing and reopening Skyrim in its entirety.
>
> Please ***DO NOT*** report bugs relating to this topic as its a flaw with Skyrim itself. There is nothing we can do to make this work!

### Stuff not covered by the wiki.

Several topics are not covered by the wiki because the are mechanically unchanged from vanilla. Some examples of this includes

1. Quests - The quests themselves are unchanged in terms of contents. what has changed about some of them is the level requirements and the difficulties
1. Staff Enchanting - this is unchanged from vanilla Dragonborn
1. How to build a hearthfire home. The fundamentals of this and requirements are unchanged.
1. civil war - Changing this would be like sticking a band-aid on a decapitation

The general rule should be - if using the wiki search bar doesnt find a result - its not changed from Vanilla.
