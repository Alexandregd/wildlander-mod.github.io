## Description

Zenithar, the nordic God of Work and Commerce is considered a god of merchants and middle nobility, being the deity of wealth, labor, commerce, communication and community. His priests teach that the path to peace and prosperity is through earnest work and honest profit, not through war, bloodshed, or theft. Zenithar is also seen as a warrior god, one that prefers peace and prosperity, but even he understands that it has to be earned.

Using what we know of him, for starters we will be using iron-themed equipment such as iron heavy armor and iron mace, mace being a callback to his creation for Pelinal Whitestrake. Due time we could upgrade to steel and nordic with mace and shield and steel, dawnguard to nordic (only slightly better than dawnguard, so I leave it for you to decide) for the armor. At the end we want to acquire stalhrim heavy sets, as Zenithar would be amazed that his follower acquired the knowledge and skills to create one.

As of magic, followers of Zenithar believe that magicka is in the constant cycle, given from people to Gods so Gods can give it for people. Because of that, we will try to enchant some of our equipment for magicka regeneration, to speed things up. We will focus only on Restoration school, as being a Zenithar’s Resolute you also serve the community, so Heal Self and Healing Hands would be the most useful spells in your arsenal.

We will choose the Stone of Lover for that sweet extra speech - mostly and only for roleplaying reasons. If you don’t want that, I suggest Stone of a Steed, for more stamina.
