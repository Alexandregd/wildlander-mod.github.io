# Description

Classic Barbarian build who have no clue about magic or stealth. Uses Warhammers as main weapon and Bows as a ranged dmg source. Though, Greatsword/Battleaxe can be used in the early game since they are faster & more effective. The build uses Savior's Hide and enchanted Scaled armor for the looks. It's theoretically a max melee damage build with Evasion perks + Warhammer + Orc. Defensively Zenithar's 350 AR covers the lack of AR from wearing a Light Armor, bringing it to a decent heavy armor levels of AR 900+ which is required for late game. Volendrung for the big hammer dmg and solving any kind of stamina problems late game.
You can make different combinations of this Barbarian build with Nord/Redguard, Greatsword/Battleaxe focus, Stendarr/Talos as well.

# Recommended Weapons / Spells

Any Warhammer -> Dawnguard Warhammer / Skyforge Steel Warhammer  -> Longhammer -> Volendrung

# Recommended Armor / Clothing
- The Savior's Hide is a fantastic Daedric Artifact for this build, as it gives you some much-needed magic resistance along with several other benefits. Obtain it through the quest "Ill Met by Moonlight", started in the Falkreath graveyard (Make sure to kill Sinding).
- Other than that, the most effective light armor you can get your hands on.

Armor: Enchanted Scaled Armor -> Savior Hide
Other slots: Enchanted Scaled Armor -> Enchanted Glass
