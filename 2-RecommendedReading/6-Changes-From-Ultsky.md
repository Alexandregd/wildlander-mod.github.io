## Things which are not currently in release build

* Dungeon darkness is not compatible with lighting mod so has been removed.
* You cannot build your own home with Atronoch’s crossing - it hasn't been ported to SE, and this is beyond our abilities to port ourselves sadly
* Skyrim souls has been removed - no more unpaused menus
* Fishing is currently very broken (In terms of gold able to be earned from fished up junk)
* Spell sword / Smart cast aren’t in SE.
* Locked City Gates is broken on SE so has been removed.
* Undeath is not in the build
* Immersive armors is no longer included
* There isn't a way of carrying large sums of coin around - Imperial mail and Merchant notes aren't in this build.
* Paper world map has gone - replaced with Quality world map which is less….. Tetchy
* Easy wheel is gone.
* Immersive COW has been replaced with Obscures - which no longer has the “classes” feature.
* Hejarchen Farm was removed due to being unable to balance patch the mod in time for release

## Functionality changes

* You can't set up camp in or near cities, towns and villages - you need to move approx 20 meters away from any city/town gates to be able to drop a tent.
* Enemy's following you out of caves and stuff is slightly broken in this build
* Food will no longer spoil
* Getting drunk / catching an illness no longer makes you motion sick.
* Helgan is locked - no more free loot
* You can now see how much gold and arrows weigh in your inventory
* Iequip is back (yay!)
* Bathing in Skyrim has been replaced with a much better pair of mods.
* All the key binds have changed
* Torches no longer extinguish themselves in poor weather
* Extended cities and towns is being rewritten from scratch and therefore a lot of the towns which had shops which you may be used to, are now missing (E.G Ivarstead no longer has a blacksmith)
* Everyone now has a real name (can be confusing if you see someone armed, as you won't know if they are hostile or not until they are trying to fill you full of holes)
* Water/skooma kegs are no longer in the game and have been replaced with mead kegs.
* Tree’s can no longer be felled, only harvested for a small amount of wood
* City guards now follow you if you act shady.
* Bandoliers and pouches have been removed, to compensate a large backpack is in place.
* Winterhold now has a carriage


## Crafting Changes
* Flutes can no longer be spammed to give masses of gold and blacksmithing XP, now require Milk and a cooking pot to craft and grant no XP - Sorry folks this exploit has been fixed.
* Crafting now has a toolkit mechanic, which are required to craft recipes (and act as filters for the large amount of items that are in game to craft)
* You can now craft chests and place those.
* There's a new crafting keybind to break down items into components.
