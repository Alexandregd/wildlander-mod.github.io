* All encounters are no longer leveled, the appearance of a given NPC or creature only depends on your current location and luck.

* Some creature encounter lists have been altered, for example you will see more small than large mudcrabs and more wolves than bears.

* Loot is no longer dependent on your level, but high quality items are of course much rarer.

* Quests rewards are decoupled from your level.

* Most locks are no longer leveled.

* Trap damage is now independent of your level and therefore much higher and often even lethal. 

* Your enemies are more skilled than before. If somebody wields a mace, you better expect some armor crushing blows from him.

* Weapon damage has increased significantly, especially archery, which is now deadly. A skilled archer can frequently take out an unarmored humanoid with a single shot. But drawing a bow now also takes considerably more time.

* Blocking and/or dodging is now essential if you want to survive melee combat.

* Some quests have had starting requirements changed to accommodate for the rewards, no more doing daedric weapon quests at level 5.

* Survival has a much, much greater importance, you can and will die if you don't eat, sleep or stay warm.

* Houses have had their prices or quest requirements altered.

* Dragons are the flying, magic casting tanks with teeth that you should be afraid of.

* Dragon priests are even worse. 

* Blacksmithing and enchanting are no longer mandatory, blacksmiths and court wizards can do these services for you.

* Level cap is 82, therefore Perk points are limited. Plan where you are going to spend them accordingly.

* Your initial Carry weight is lower, but you can craft or buy Backpacks to increase it.

* Weight of your armor affects your magicka pool, clothing is better for mages, Spell sword is not something to be at level one, either focus the sword or the spells. 

* Don't expect to be wearing heavy armor and running marathons from level 1. It takes perks, time, and training to master the art of being a walking tank.

* It’s dark when it's supposed to be, night vision, a torch, or lantern is required for dungeon diving.

* Getting sick and/or drunk and/or consuming a lot of alchemy ingredients gives a visual effect/blurring on your screen.

* Heavy Armor makes sneaking impossible.

* Sneak mages can’t exist. Spells Make noise to cast until you are deep into the illusion tree.

* Stamina is a precious resource at lower levels. Wearing any armor without the first perk causes a drain standing still, even with the first perk you will lose it if you are running around. Anyone with armor should be investing in stamina restoration food.

* Vampires are Allergic to sunlight, and restoration spells don't work. They have their own healing spell in the conjuration tree. 

* You are not forced to perk into lock picking. Spells for unlocking, scrolls for unlocking and just plain smacking the lock can be used instead.

* If you have played our legendary edition mod pack and want to see the differences between that build and the SE release, You can do so [here](..\2-RecommendedReading\Changes-From-Ultsky.html)
