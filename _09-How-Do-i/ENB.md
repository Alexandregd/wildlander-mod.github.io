## How Do I Change The ENB Settings?

You can edit the various Settings inside of the Shift+Enter menu in game

## Night eye is too dark

{: .note}
Performance modlist does not allow the ENB to show Night-vision correctly. Should you wish to use night-vision, you must either use "standard modlist" or No shaders (to apply vanilla night-vision)

Hit Shift+Enter to bring up the ENB, in the center panel expand ENB effect and scroll down until you find the below section:

These are the settings which control the brightness. It is my personal preference to change only 'Technique' to 'CW variant 3.'

then to scroll down and adjust the following settings

Once you are happy with the settings, in the top right section click on “save configuration,” then hit shift+enter again to hide the ENB window.
