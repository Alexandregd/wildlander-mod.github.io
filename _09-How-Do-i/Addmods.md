## How Do I Add Mods?

At present this is unsupported and unrecommended. 

Some facts before you start complaining:
- Staff are modders too, we enjoy tweaking things, a lot of the UltSky customization was done by Support staff (BMX, Anna, Lizzy and Resident Thievul). It's a given we'd have to spend some focus and time in customization channel(s) making sure the correct information is being shared.
- In terms of supporting the list itself, it's basically impossible to support every iteration of additions/subtractions in people's customizations - as such, support is 100% focused on unedited lists so we can identify genuine errors and not user generated ones.
- *There's not a forever ban on customizing the list* We just ask for some time in getting the list itself in a better state, and for the initial support burden to lessen. No official customization of anything for now allows more focus on that.
