{: .warning } 
> # **To ensure you perform a clean install - Delete your Game-files\Mods folder before continuing (the folder circled in the example below).**  

The reason for this is wabbajack reads though and CRC checks everything in the mods folder. Unfortunately this process takes a long time to do, and cant detect corrupted files 100% of the time.
