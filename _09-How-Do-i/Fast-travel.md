You will need to edit the following in-game MCM settings to re-enable fast travel:

1. Frostfall
1. Requiem
1. Sunhelm

In addition, in 1.1.0 onwards â€“ A SKSE mod disables fast travel around the map. This can be turned off in game-files\mods\Disable Fast Travel SKSE - No Janky Map UI\SKSE\Plugins\DisableFastTravel.ini
