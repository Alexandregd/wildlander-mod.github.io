# What is Wildlander?

Wildlander is the new name for "Ultimate Skyrim SE". We chose to rebrand the project to separate it from the Ultimate Skyrim list and reduce confusion.

The Wildlander mod list is a complete rebuild from the ground up so some of the features you maybe used to are not available because they haven't been converted to SE and/or it was too complex for us to do so. An example of this is "Atronoch Crossing" Additionally, some of the mods which ARE available for SE have major changes which would require rebalancing, such as "Hjarchen Farm," or simply don't work such as in the case of "Dark Dungeons," "Locked City Gates," and the full version of "Enhanced Skyrim Factions: The Companions."

This isn't to say some of these features won't return in some fashion in the next few builds, just that they didn't make the deadline for compatibility for this one. 

You can download and install from [here](https://www.wildlandermod.com/download)

----------

# Do I need to uninstall Ultsky?

Not unless you're short of hard drive space - Ultsky uses Oldrim, Wildlander uses new.

----------

# What version of Special Edition is needed?

The Steam version of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition - Update 1.6.640 (AKA the free Anniversary update) installed in English [Here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/). You do **not** need Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade, which is a DLC made available at the same time. 

If you have downgraded back to Special edition version 1.5.97, you will need to verify game files to reupdate to the latest version.

----------

# Do I need to buy The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade DLC?

No. It is not required to play Wildlander. 

We use an installation method called stock game, which copies the Skyrim files we need to the Wildlander directory. This method allows you to have Wildlander, and a separate steam installation of Skyrim.

If you already have the DLC, you can still install the content, as we will simply ignore it during the installation process and not copy it over. 

----------

# Can I add the Creation Club content / Anniversary Edition DLC to my Wildlander install?

No, This content counts as customization. It is Unsupported and Untested. Some of them are known to conflict and cause CTD's with other mods in the list.

----------

# I already have Skyrim: Legendary Edition, why do I need to buy Special Edition?

Special Edition is a completely different version of game engine (64 bit instead of 32 bit). Wildlander requires the 64-bit game engine, as it uses mods which require the 64bit version of SKSE. Therefore, Wildlander cannot be installed on Legendary Edition.

----------

# When is Ultimate Skyrim returning?

It won't be returning to the Wabbajack gallery. The Wabbajack file, along with install instructions, are currently pinned in the Ultsky Support channel on Discord.

I have no further information as to if it will be formally re-released on the Wildlander website.

----------

# How long to download without Nexus Premium?

There have been reports of anywhere from 4 hours to 4 days, depending on how much attention you are paying to the Wabbajack downloader and the speeds you are getting from your ISP. Times may also differ based on whether you are downloading to an SSD or an HDD.

----------

# Can I see the mod lists?

Standard: [Version](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/wildlander-11-official-standard-mods)

Performance: [Version](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/wildlander-11-official-potato-mods)

----------

# Can I see the differences between Ultimate Skyrim and Wildlander?

Yes - Click [Here](..\2-RecommendedReading\6-Changes-From-Ultsky.html)

----------

# Does this mod pack support other languages?

No, and if you try, then SKSE crashes from Mod Organizer. You will need to install English Skyrim - Special Edition to play this modpack.

----------

# How do I update to the current version?

Backup any changes you have made to the modpack since your original install, as these will be lost. If you want to keep any mods you've added to your personal install, rename those mods to start with &#96;[NoDelete]&#96; to force Wabbajack to skip those files. Note that support still won't be officially provided; use this feature at your own discretion. 

Then follow the instructions [here](..\16-OtherResouces\How-to-update.html)

The latest version will always be available [here](https://www.wildlandermod.com/download) for clean installations

{: .warning}
Some updates will require a brand-new game and are not save compatible.

----------

# Do I have to update?

No. All updates require you to manually run Wabbajack to download and install the latest mods for the new build.


----------

# How do I uninstall?

We're sorry to see you leave!

Uninstalling Wildlander is a simple matter of deleting the installation folder.

Uninstalling the launcher requires you to use Windows “Add / remove program” functionality.

----------

# Can I remove the downloads' folder?

Yes, but if you want to install an update, or repair your install, you would need to redownload all 500+ mods.

You can however safely move your download folder to another hard drive.

# **Launcher Questions**

{% include Wabbajack_AV.md %}


{% include Wabbajack_Launcher.md %}

----

# **Customization Questions**

## I'm nosey, There are Errors in mod organizer, why is this stuff disabled?

1) Reporting files in overwrite folder: These are your crash logs.
2) All the NPC overhauls are disabled: They are supposed to be, as they are just dummy files to ensure the authors get download credit. Hence “DEV RESOURCES” label.
3) There are mods with Red X's: These are merged into the Wildlander ESP. It is perfectly normal.
4) Mod XXX is out of date: Perfectly normal for mod lists to have older versions of mods. Some mods update several times a month and the list won't ever be able to keep up.

Finally, you should be using the launcher to play. Entering mod organizer is NOT NECESSARY unless you are running Window 7.

---------

## Mod X has been updated, can I install that?

No. For stability reasons, only the versions installed by Wabbajack are supported.

----------

## Can i edit MCM settings?

The answer to this is support strongly recommend that you leave them alone.  Everything is setup how it is intended to play. We didn't "accidentally" forgot to turn on some settings (Wildcat only exists for its AI not for all the other features). 

We are not responsible for any errors or bugs which occur if you edit them.

FLP MCM should be treated as though it doesn't exist - No seriously -  Touch nothing in here unless you enjoy for followers picking up random shit and running around in circles while you are fighting for your life.

----------

## Can I remove/disable mod X

Many mods have a Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) where they can be turned off. You cannot disable anything completely from Mod Organizer, and doing so will deny you access to support.

----------

## Can I add additional mods?

Currently, we are not supporting any form of modification of Wildlander.

Any modifications are done at your own risk and will deny you access to support.

Changing the mod list (Even simple changes) can break mod lists in surprising ways. Requiem touches all parts of Skyrim and generally requires patches to add anything.

If you want to do it anyway: I will give this free advice DO NOT run LOOT, it will break the mod list any mods should be added and ordered manually. Remember that, again, this WILL deny you access to support.

---
##  But I want CBBE/UNP nudes

Answer is still no. Go straight to horny jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect 200 Septims.

---
# **Gameplay Questions**

## Can I see a list of Known issues

Sure. Here's a [link](..\1-SupportPages\KnownIssues.html)

----------

## How can I see the keybindings?

The in-game hotkey F11 will bring up a Game pad / keyboard layout of all key bindings. F11 again will hide it.

----------

## My keybindings don't work

Dylan is based in the US, so the key bindings were based on a standard QWERTY US keyboard.

For any other types of keyboards you will need to rebind the keys yourself from the MCM menus.

There is an appropriate guide [here](..\2-RecommendedReading\8-Keybindings.html) 

----------

## How Do I do a customized start (vampire, werewolf, no perks)

When you get the message that Wildlander is finalizing and have clicked OK, hit F10.

Wildlander will then go into manual configuration mode.

Once you get the message warning you that you hit F10. Hit 'OK', then 'escape.'

Then go to Mod Configuration Menu and Skyrim. From there you can use 'Skyrim Unbound Reborn' MCM and customize how you want to start exactly.

----------
## Some sounds aren't playing! How do I fix this?

If you are unable to hear most of the combat sounds such as sword swings, spell useage (ex: flame, heal, etc.), opening a container, footsteps, etc but are able to hear NPC dialogue, drawing or sheathing a sword and wolves in the distance:

If you are willing to customize (and know how to use mod organizer to install mods) [Latge Sector fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71567?tab=description) may fix the issue.

If not check first to see if your Skyrim install is in the 'C' drive (C:). Installing Skyrim outside the C: has been known to cause this issue. If you do not want to reinstall the game to C:, a quick fix originally posted by Kepache may be attempted:

1. First download and install Link Shell Extension, which can be found [here](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html).
2. Navigate to your Skyrim/Data folder and look for a file named Skyrim - Sounds.bsa. Copy this file and paste it somewhere on your main drive (I suggest creating a folder for this purpose).
3. Delete Skyrim - Sounds.bsa from the Data folder.
4. Go back to where you copied Skyrim - Sounds.bsa on your main drive. Right click on it, and you should see an option that says “Pick Link Source”. Click that.
5. Go back to your Skyrim/Data folder. Right click anywhere and choose “Drop As” and then “Symbolic Link”. You will see your sounds file with a shortcut symbol.

You also need to do the above for Skyrim - Voices_en0.bsa also found in the Skyrim Data folder

You may need to do it for the following 3 folders. Some people do, some don't:

1. Audio Overhaul Skyrim for SE sound folder found in Game-files\mods\Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE—All files in sound subdirectory
2. Immersive Sound – Compendium sound folder found in Game-files\mods\Immersive Sounds – Compendium – All Files in sound subdirectory
3. Unofficial High Definition Audio Project – all BSA files in all three folders found in Game-files\mods

----------

## Why can't I learn the first crafting perk?

This only affects version 1.0.

You need a book called The Craftsman's Manual in your inventory. It can be purchased from most blacksmiths. Most of the Requiem crafting perks require their own books, some of which can be bought while others must be found in the world.

For 1.1 onwards: If you want to re-enable this functionality, then you can do so from the Requiem MCM.

----------

## Why can't I run or Why is my stamina going down for no reason?

Requiem applies a stamina draining effect when you run, and when you wear armor without the first perk in the Heavy Armor/Evasion tree. Running is the normal speed you move as if you aren't sprinting or specifically holding down the “walk” button. To combat this, make sure to buy food with a “Regenerate 1 stamina per second for 'X' seconds” effect and keep that buff up at all times. The wiki page [Stamina Management](..\3-YourFirstCharacter\Stamina.html) provides more detailed information.

**NO, YOU CANNOT DISABLE IT, PLEASE DON'T ASK!**

----------

## Why can't I get a blessing at a shrine?

Requiem's gods are unforgiving of crime. Too much crime, or an outstanding bounty and they will no longer bless you or heal you! Please see the wiki page [Religion & The Divines](..\4-WildlanderWorld\4-The-Divines.html) for more information.

----------

## Why am I not healing?

Wildlander has no passive health regeneration. You will not heal from your wounds by "sleeping it off".

When you get hurt fighting - the only ways to heal are :-

* Restoration spells (for the living)
* Conjuration spells (for the undead)
* Health potions (For undead, only max level healing potions (superlative) will work.)
* [Healing Poultice](..\3-YourFirstCharacter\Health.html#healing-poultice)
* Alchemy Perk
* Raw Ingredients
* Enchantments

----------

## Lights are flickering on and off?

It's most noticeable in Breezehome and the entrance to Riverwood at night, but this can happen everywhere.

This is caused by Skyrim's engine limitation of 4 "shadow casting" light sources in an area. When you look in an area with more than 4 light sources, they alternate/cycle and turn on and off. Turn off your lantern or put away your torch to potentially alleviate this to some degree.

----------

## Why is everything so expensive in shops?

There are several possible reasons:
 
1. You're NAKED! Put some clothes on, ya filthy animal!
2. You're covered in BLOOD and/or MUD!  Honestly! Traipsing mud over my clean floors! I am gonna charge you a cleaning fee! Go take a BATH!
3. You may also be hated by the community or the shopkeeper for... reasons you likely remember, but won't tell anyone about! Grease those palms with the Speechcraft menu and give that shopkeeper a little gift, such as gems or coin off the cuff! That should help lower the prices...
4. You may also just suck at talking. Level your Speechcraft so you're not tripping over your words like a milkdrinker fresh to the local inn. You can't honestly expect to sell your wares for a decent price when your best sales pitch is 'Unga-bunga!' 

----------

## My character's animations are stuck!

This is a vanilla Skyrim bug, which is exacerbated by the scripted mods in Wildlander. If jumping doesn't fix the animation, try the following console commands:

{: .console}
> Pushactoraway 14 1
>
> SetPlayerAIDriven 0


----

## Why can't I 'Fast Travel' ?

Because we disable it 🙂 There are multiple methods of moving around the map quickly without editing these settings – There are boats near most large area of water, and Carriage drivers at the cities.

You will need to edit the following in-game MCM settings to reenabled fast travel:
1. Frostfall
2. Requiem 
3. Sunhelm 

In addition in 1.1.X – A SKSE mod disables fast travel around the map. This can be turned off in game-files\mods\Disable Fast Travel SKSE - No Janky Map UI\SKSE\Plugins\DisableFastTravel.ini

----------

## My game freezes during loading screens.

The game will pause if you are alt-tabbed out, including some load screens. Make sure Skyrim window has focus!

The primary cause for this is a insufficiant [page file](../2-RecommendedReading/1-BeforeYouBegin.html#page-files). You can click the link for instructions on how to increase.

Can also be caused by :
- Your PC being below the minimum requirements to play the pack as shown on the installation README. You can try running without a ENB from the launcher.
- Wildlander folders (or subfolders) being read-only.
- Wildlander being on a different drive to Skyrim: It is recommended that you have Wildlander and Skyrim on the same drive. 
- Wildlander being installed inside of program files: Move the Wildlander folder outside of program files.
- Additional mods in Skyrim/data folder from previous modding or workshop subscriptions are causing a conflict.
- Conflict between AMD drivers and the ENB: The only resolution to this is to either roll back until you find working AMD drivers or disable ENB graphics until a working driver is available.
- A corrupt Skyrim installation: To check, launch Skyrim from steam and see if it crashes on loading screen. If it crashes, the installation is corrupted.
- Antivirus real-time scanning your Wildlander folders: Make sure you add it to your exceptions.
- You have lost permissions to write to “My Documents\My Games\Skyrim” or Wildlander install folder
- OneDrive and/or Dropbox is Syncing your “my documents\My Games\Skyrim” or Wildlander install folder
- Can be caused by a corrupt save. You can try using a previous save or start a new game.

----------

## How do I change the difficulty?

The in-game difficulty sliders do not work with Wildlander. Please use the Change Difficulty hotkey instead (Right-CTRL).

----------

## Help! I'm being attacked by Anorath & Uthgard the Unbroken in Whiterun for no reason!

You have somehow picked up a bounty in Whiterun hold which does not show on the UI, also known as a 'Hidden Bounty.' What have you been doing in secret, HMMM?

No matter. The following console command will clear it:

{: .console}
> paycrimegold 0 0

----------

## I contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, and now I can't sleep!

This is a 'Requiem' change that prevents weak characters from acquiring Vampirism. You must survive for 3 days while Sanguinare Vampiris slowly drains health and negates natural healing, at which point you will become a Vampire. You better hope you can afford healing potions or haven't made enemies of temple healers!

You cannot Wait or Sleep to pass the time, however spell research and training do work.

----------

## Can I remove Block/Parry from control

Yes! The keybinding for this is in Dual Wield Block. Lizzy (being the sensible player that she is) switches it to 'C' and moves crouch using the Skyrim standard controls back to the default key bind.

----------

## How do I put my shield on my back

Go to game-files\mods\Simple Dual Sheath\SKSE\Plugins\SimpleDualSheath.ini and edit the flags on the below section:

{: .iniSetting}
>[ShieldOnBack]
>
> Flags=Player


Save and next time you boot the game. Your shield will now be on your back, you 🐢 cosplayer! 

----------
## Night eye is too dark

{: .note}
Performance modlist does not allow the ENB to show Nightvision correctly. Should you wish to use nightvision, you must either use "standard modlist" or No shaders (to apply vanilla nightvision)

Hit Shift+Enter to bring up the ENB, in the center panel expand ENB effect and scroll down until you find the below section:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26418143/175901531-69ed7701-e295-4a8f-933a-5cbb85dc85c4.png)

These are the settings which control the brightness. It is my personal preference to change only 'Technique' to 'CW variant 3.'

then to scroll down and adjust the following settings 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26418143/197895203-bf895835-7dbc-44e8-ae8e-dae5e650e3d1.png)

Once you are happy with the settings, in the top right section click on “save configuration,” then hit shift+enter again to hide the ENB window.

----------

## How Do I Enable Permadeath

Are you MAD? Skyrim will kill you just for sneezing on a rock wrong and you want...?

No, but there is a serious, technical reason! There is no enforced permadeath mode because all mods pertaining to this feature are known to cause issues. So, instead of a 'permadeath mod' the player, upon dying, is presented with the Requiem death dialog telling you to load a save. If you wish to be permadeath, then you should exit and restart Skyrim at this point, then create a new character.

Think of it as... an exercise in self-discipline, if you like!

{: .note}
Creating a new character without restarting Skyrim is known to cause script issues in several mods. Many options during character creation may be missing! Spells and gear during the start-up will not be correctly assigned, and you may get pop-up's from Trade and Barter due to it not initializing correctly, so make sure you restart Skyrim COMPLETELY, through the launcher, before attempting to create a new character!

## Why are kill-moves disabled?

Requiem kill moves have been edited from vanilla settings. They can now be performed on the Player, by enemies. and they can now be performed on any enemy - not just the last.

Below are a few reasons why:

- You are attacked by a melee opponent. You plan to 🛡️ the attack and will survive it, but the game engine decides otherwise and plays a kill move. Under standard Requiem, kill moves can be performed on the player. The result is now you are eating dirt when you should be bashing skulls! (the same if you plan to evade the attack).
- You are sneaking and aim an arrow on a mage. This will one-shot the mage. The kill move plays, the mage becomes aware of you, suddenly it's no longer a sneak attack, the mage lives and turns you into one of three elemental flavors of magically prepared rump roast. 
- You sneak behind a bandit, you plan to one-shot him with a dagger attack. The attack succeeds, the kill move plays, nobody detects you, but the bandit didn't die, is still full health turns around, says ~~"Omae wa, mou shindaeru..."~~ and kills you.
- You are sniping with a bow. Every arrow will kill a bandit. Every time you release the arrow, a kill-move plays. But thanks to the kill move, every arrow lands on the ground before it reaches the bandit, therefore the bandit didn't die, and now instead of being 'Legolas' you have become 'Legless' thanks to that big bandit with the greatsword.
- You are attacking a group of enemies with a 2-handed Axe and mid-fight a kill move fires (as in Requiem they can happen on any enemy), and his friends kill you while the cinematic plays, because you are not in fact Neo from blockbuster hit 'The Matrix.'
- You are sneaking on a ridge above Valheim Towers and shoot arrows to the bandits below you. All arrows hit and one-shot, except the one from the kill move, which collides with the invisible barrier of the ridge. You are now detected. You proceed to beat your keyboard into a fine pulp, then craft it into a sword because archery is now for pansies.
- You are shooting ⚡ from your fingertips like some kind of unspecified villain in a space opera. It has been an intense battle, and you are about to win. You channel your last reserves of magic at your foe, and the kill camera activates, missing your target and attacking the aggressive invisible ant which threatens to nibble your toes. The vampire mage you almost slew then summons a Storm Atronach, which proceeds to turn you into an ad-hoc Christmas tree in approximately three seconds. As a reward for your heroism, Todd Howard grants you the sight of another kill cam, this time of the aformentioned Storm Atronach putting little a wreathe around your neck while the vampire dances on your twitching, electrified corpse.

Kill moves literally mean that when such a move plays, 90% of the time it kills you, the other 10% of the time nothing happens. 

**Will it break anything if I turn them on anyway**

Possibly your mouse, controller or keyboard when you throw them from frustration from the 5th time one of the above events happens to you?

---

# **Questing Questions**

## How do I start the main quest

Kill a dragon. It's not as simple as it sounds. In Wildlander, Dragons are the heavily armored flying tanks with elemental shouts or worse, such as those which drain vitality or other attributes. This turns them into the legitimate threat they should have always been, so stack magic resistances, enchants, and maybe even a good shield! Good luck in not becoming a crispy-critter~!

----------

## Why can't I obtain the Dragonstone?

This quest is auto completed when you kill a dragon. Also, there will be a book on 'Racial Phylogeny' inside the crypt, so make sure you bring that to Farengar. He needs it for... research.

----------

## How do I Become Thane of Whiterun?

There is a new way of becoming a Thane of Whiterun:

Complete “The Blessings of Nature” quest (Danica by the Gildrergreen tree to start) and talk to Jarl Balgruuf when the Gildergreen tree is repaired or the sapling blooms (This requires you to complete any other quest outside of whiterun itself to simulate the passing of time). He'll thank you and allow you to do the standard thane quest (help the people of the hold).

{: .hint}
You can buy Breezehome before this at a much more expensive price, but unless you are thane you do not get a housecarl.

----------

## I can't start the Thieves Guild through Brynjolf?

Thieves Guild Requirements is included in the list, which requires 25 pockets picked and 250 items stolen. So get to it, Robin Hood! They don't just let ANYBODY into the Thieves Guild these days (Even though attendance is low and they aren't exactly in a spot to BE picky...)!

----------

## How do I start the Dragonborn quest line?

Dragonborn content is available after completing “A Blade in the Dark” during the Main Quest.

----------
## How do I progress The Companions storyline?

You need to do 5 radiant quests for members of the Circle in between each faction quest.


# **Crafting Questions**

## How do I craft Snowberry Extract

Snowberry Extract is made directly from a cookpot, or by using the player crafting menu when in proximity to a cookpot

The extract requires the following items/tools:

> * A survivalist's or alchemist's toolkit
> * Alchemical Lore 1 (perk)
> * 20 Snowberries

----------

## How do I craft Healing Poultice?

The Healing poultice [Guide](..\3-YourFirstCharacter\Health.html#healing-poultice) explains the crafting method and requirements.
