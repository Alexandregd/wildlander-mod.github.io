## Frequent discord topics

There has been a great amount of feedback over the last 12 months relating to the pack - a lot of it Duplicated - to the extent that its spawned a Meme on the official discord.

To cover some of the topics commonly discussed

1. Alchemy Being too "OP"

We are aware its broken and that you can make great deals of money from it. Unfortunately this isn't a easy fix. 

- The XP you gain from making a potion is directly tied to its sell price.
- Its sell price is tied to the number of effects the potion has.

We cannot reduce the sell price without reducing the XP gained from making the potion.  

1. Magic Being OP

This is currently default requiem and is scheduled for correction at the same time as magic is expanded in the pack.

1. NPC Appearances

We get people complaining they are too pretty. We get people complaining they are too Ugly. At the end of the day - its Dylans List - He likes them this way. 

1. Favorite Mod not being included

We currently have nearly 1000 suggested mods on the trello - If everyone's Favorite Mod was included - it would be 5 times the size and released in about a decade.

1. Spell Research too Complex.

We know, and Agree - thats why it isn't compulsory to use it.

1. People being Unable to Read

We have a Wiki - You're on it. How about searching for a answer before asking support staff?

1. Asking About Customization.

Soon. The list is in a stable enough state to open it - we are just waiting on Dylan to write up the supporting documents

1. List is too Easy / Difficult.

For Requiem Veteran's this list is probably too easy - not not everyone is a veteran. Staff are actively discussing a "hard mode" version of the modpack.

## Other feedback

1. Vampire is terrible

Yes, We agree that the instant death when you go into sunlight is a bit much - perhaps we will change it to a Damage over time.

1. I hate the follower Mod.

We know there are issues with followers not doing what you want - we will be taking a look.

1. Enchanted Spheres / Enemies with regen

We will be addressing this.

1. Loot in chests is Rubbish

More dangerous the chest is to get to... the better the loot. Openworld chests have the worst - Boss chests have the best.
