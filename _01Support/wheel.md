There has been a great amount of feedback over the last 12 months relating to the pack - a lot of it Duplicated - to the extent that its spawned a Meme on the official discord.

To cover some of the topics commonly discussed

##  1. Alchemy Being too "OP"

We are aware its broken and that you can make great deals of money from it. Unfortunately this isn't a easy fix. 

- The XP you gain from making a potion is directly tied to its sell price.
- Its sell price is tied to the number of effects the potion has.

We cannot reduce the sell price without reducing the XP gained from making the potion.  

## 2. Magic Being OP

This is currently default requiem and is scheduled for correction at the same time as magic is expanded in the pack.

## 3. NPC Appearances

We get people complaining they are too pretty. We get people complaining they are too Ugly. At the end of the day - it's Dylan's List - He likes them this way. 

## 4. Favorite Mod not being included

We currently have over 1000 suggested mods on the trello - If everyone's Favorite Mod was included - it would be 5 times the size and released in about a decade.

## 5. Spell Research too complex.

We know, and Agree - thats why it isn't compulsory to use it.

## 6. Asking About customization.

Soon. The list is in a stable enough state to open it - we are just waiting on Dylan to write up the supporting documents

## 7. List is too Easy / Hard.

For Requiem Veteran's this list is probably too easy - not everyone is a veteran. Staff are actively discussing a "hard mode" version of the modpack.

For Requiem Beginners - the list is too hard. which is why we wrote the wiki to help you get started ;)

## 8. Why is night-vision so rubbish?

Because we have a ENB - and the default preset for Rudy makes it this way - The FAQ has some settings to improve it.

## 9. Vampire is terrible

Yes, We agree that the instant death when you go into sunlight is a bit much - perhaps we will change it to a Damage over time or use a alternate vampire overhaul.

## 10. I hate the follower Mod. They never do what I want and just stand there.

We know there are issues with followers not doing what you want - we will be taking a look. But in the meantime - make sure you havent accidentally toggled them into formation.

## 11. Enchanted Spheres / Enemies with regen too strong

We will be addressing this.

## 12. Loot in chests is Rubbish

More dangerous the chest is to get to... the better the loot. Open world chests have the worst - Boss chests have the best.
