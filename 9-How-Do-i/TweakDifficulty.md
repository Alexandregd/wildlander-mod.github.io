## How Do I tweak the difficulty??

If you find combat is still not to your liking on Easy mode, you can adjust the amount of damage you take in the Requiem MCM.

If the survival elements are getting to you, Sunhelm and/or Frostfall can be adjusted (or turned off) in their respective MCMs. 

If you are finding the survival aspect too easy - you can increase the difficulty by increasing your exposure within frostfall
