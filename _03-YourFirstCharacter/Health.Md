Wildlander has no passive health regeneration. You will not heal from your wounds by "sleeping it off". 

When you get hurt fighting - the only ways to heal are :-

- Restoration spells (for the living)
- Conjouration spells (for the undead)
- Health potions (For undead, only max level healing potions (superlative) will work.)
- Healing Poultice (see note below) 
- Alchemy Perk
- Raw Ingredients
- Enchantments
- Engraved bones (Kynareth): gives passive health regen for the duration.

## Healing Poultice 

Healing poultices are SLOW action healers, but heal for a lot. If you engage in combat or sprint while the effect is active, it will be suspended for the duration of said combat or sprint action, and reactivate a few seconds after. It is therefore recommended that you only use healing poultices in a safe place, and that you wait for at least an hour for the effect to work.
