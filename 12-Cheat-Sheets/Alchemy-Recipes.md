# Money Potions

**Early game**


_Safe places to collect_

Collect RMF, BMF, Lavender, Thistle Branch on roads around Whiterun and Riverwood

Also, Collect RMF, BMF Lavender, Thistle Branch on roads around Solitude

RMF, BMF is available in the cold regions, too (You'll need lots)

Collect Hanging Moss around Markarth, especially on roads heading east (you'll get encounters if you go place the shrine of Dibella and if you head north towards Kolkegger Mine, so be careful)

Collect Spider Eggs in Helgen

Hawk Feathers from shooting hawks in Solitude

Collect and obsess wildly over Garlic in every town (though Whiterun and Solitude are probably the best). You can steal it without it being a crime if you are hidden and it's hanging in a bundle, don't take the individual one's on the ground.) Houses in Solitude have a lot of stealable garlic in the houses and low-level locks on the doors. If you become friendly with anyone (say Sven) get into their house and take all their Garlic

Salt you can find in bags, but I usually buy it

Slaughterfish Eggs are available in large quantity on the north coast between Dawnstar in the water.
