It's a big scary world out there beyond Riverwood or wherever your character is starting, and you should never leave home without some essential equipment and adventuring gear. Otherwise you end up like me the time I forgot both a bedroll AND my waterskins. I've always had a checklist of items I bring before venturing out and wanted to share it to help out other roleplayers, prepare new players for surviving monster and mod hazards.

## On your person

* Primary weapon (2H weapon, 1H + shield, Bow, Staff etc.)
* Backup weapon (Just in case)
* Hunting knife - Purpose for processsing animal carcasses into its parts / pelt / meat.
* Main armor pieces / Clothing
* Enchanted jewelry
* 1 full waterskin
* Fur backpack 
* 500 Septims
* Cold-weather clothing (generally fur cloak + fur-lined hood, the ones that give +42 warmth)
* Iron lantern (for lighting in dark places - use L to toggle on and off as needed)

## On your Horse

* Pickaxe (for mining)
* Woodcutter's Axe (if you dont use a war axe as primary weapon, for chopping trees to get wood in case you need a fire)
* 8 pieces of wood + 2 crude tinder + 16 kindling (optional for starting fires; chop/forage instead if weight is an issue)
* 3 days of food: you can always hunt or forage more later (add passive stamina regen dishes)
* 4 full waterskins / 16 bottles of water
* Bedroll or fur/leather tent (to sleep and keep warm while doing so)
* Cooking pot (I mostly use primitive cooking to heat raw meat, but I like the aesthetic of the pot on the pack plus setting it up at camp)
* 1-2 Healing Poultice, or the materials to make one
* Wooden Chest / barrel (for additional storage)
* 1-2 Cure Disease Potions

## Warrior/thief 

* Ranged weapon + 30 arrows/bolts
* 10 potions (mix of healing, stamina, magicka for mage characters, and some utility potions
* Inkwell + Quill (for Spell Research or just to RP journal in Take Notes)
* Cold-weather armor (generally fur armor feet/hands/chest; also good if you're a HA character who needs to sneak)
* 15 lockpicks (or scrolls of knock if you aren't lockpick proficient)
* 1-2 skill books for late night reading
* 2-3 soap bars (especially plain soap if I plan on sneaking)
* Amulet of Harvest Moon (for wilderness trips if you plan to forage food)
* Handful of engraved bones (Hircine most important; optional if your character would know this magical item)
* "Oh shit" ace-in-the-hole (invis potion to run, storm atronach scroll for muscle, paralysis potion for single target kills, etc.)

## Mage

* 2-3 soap bars 
* 10 potions (mix of healing, stamina, magicka for mage characters) 
* Inkwell + Quill + Paper (for Spell Research or just to journal in Take Notes)
* Cold-weather armor (generally fur armor feet/hands/chest) If you get caught in a snowstorm
* Utility scrolls - for when low on magic
* scrolls of knock if you arent capable of casting the spell itself.
* "Oh shit" ace-in-the-hole (invis potion to run, storm atronach scroll for muscle)
