Location: Riften, Temple of Mara, lower floor.<br/>
NPC: Alessandra, gravekeeper of the Hall of the Dead.<br/>

Bug:<br/>
NPC voiceline says she would like to make peace with her father and requests dragonborn to deliver an item to Anders, the gravekeeper in Whiterun, but her voiceline says Anders is located in &quot;Windhelm&quot; instead of Whiterun.<br/>
<br/>
The Subtitles write &quot;Whiterun&quot;, but her voice over says Windhelm.<br/>

**Detailed Description**<br/>
When an NPC drinks a potion, the drinking sound is same volume as when I drink one, which is too loud to begin with, and definitely too loud when an NPC is far away from me (for example fornsworn fighting with guards and I&#39;m not next to them).<br/>
<br/>
Suggestion: Disable the drinking sound completely, if it isn&#39;t possible to disable it only for NPCs<br/>

_Detailed Description_<br/>
Ultra Graphics<br/>
<br/>
Approaching Weynon Stones from all angles seems fine. The ice wraiths spawn simply enough, but as soon as one is killed - some kind of weird attack/teleportation happens which immediately strikes my character no matter the range. Tested with fireballs. The screen immediately goes to black, HUD is still visible, but game is non-responsive. HUD Contrast changes and color bleeding occurs. There is still a sound of wind, and a crackling of fire/branches regardless of if I&#39;m near one. Mouse completely freezes.<br/>

*Detailed Description*<br/>
High Graphics<br/>
<br/>
When zooming out, (not in) from first person to third person the game glitches and a few frames you see your character from a different position before it adjusts. I tried disabling smoothcamera, and some other camera mods to see if they are the problem; didn&#39;t work. Also tried doing a complete fresh install of Wildlander and starting a new save; didn&#39;t work either.<br/>
<br/>
I tried different graphics settings, but all got the same problem<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Not sure. The problem appeared all of a sudden after killing that large spider for the quest in Markarth. I&#39;ve got videos of the issue though<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a slow-motion video that I took with my phone: https://imgur.com/a/1yFuMDX (not sure what to select with console, as it&#39;s a camera issue but feel free to contact me for more information)<br/>

This did not occur when I had only the daedric smithing perk.

I have never had the arcane smithing perk across any save.<br/>

Especially for the fishing mod, but more broadly all cooking, there are entries such as salmon bake which are harder to produce than just &quot;cooked salmon&quot; that provide LESS nutritional value than cooked salmon. No fishing meats have been turned into Requiem meals. Many many many meals are not properly balanced for requiem. And I&#39;m not sure if this is relevant, but &quot;homecooked meal&quot; from spouse gives a % buff instead of numeric - which contrasts with all Requiem food buffs, so that probably needs a change as well for posterity&#39;s sake.<br/>

[Crafting]Keywords on equipment resulting in incorrect tempering values
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Crafting<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
Ultra Graphics<br/>
<br/>
Looking through SSEEdit a number of equipment items / types have a large number of additional keywords which allows for them to gain the benefit of multiple tempering perks unintentionally. OR the Smithing perks have far too many conditions on them, allowing them to overlap on equipment (see Craftmanship and Scale Armor Perks for example). See Scale armour for an example, it has a number of additional keywords that are also used in the perk conditions within Smithing, creating a lot of overlap, so that by the time you can craft Elven gear (Elven Smithing ONLY increases Elven tempering) it&#39;s already worse than Scale.<br/>
<br/>
I would advise removing addition and unneeded keywords from items so that they fit within a specific group or be more specific withing the smithing perks to prevent duplicate impacts. Even creating specific smithing perk keywords and only using those (as Requiem originally used).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Check keywords in SSEEdit, check tempering values in game with and without Smithing perks - Scale and Elven armour is a good test case.<br/>

*This crash(AKA The Shadow Scene Crash) has been known to appear with a combination of lighting, camera, and behavior issues. People have mentioned facelight mods to also be a cause for this issue. I have had this issue numerous times in the past, however, and haven&#39;t used a facelight at all. This issue may be resolved in a future update in SSE Engine Fixes\!\! stay tuned\!\!\! WORKAROUND: Simply deleting any mods with facelight could be of help as that has been a source of multiple types of CTDs in this guide so far

[CTD]Approaching Eorlund Gray-Mane about placing a crafting order and proceeding to scroll through the items causes a CTD after a random interval of time
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: CTD<br/>
**Detailed Description**<br/>
I couldn&#39;t manage to pinpoint if a specific item was causing the CTD but every time I tried scrolling through the items it would, without fail, CTD. I tried this on multiple saves, new characters and fresh installations. It initially happened on version 1.1.4 but not too long ago 1.1.5 was released and the issue persisted on that version too. I&#39;m unsure whether this happens at other blacksmiths. I am pretty new to massive mod lists like this one so I apologize if this is a known issue already. I did read the current issues and couldn&#39;t find anything similar so I thought I&#39;d just report it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the crafting order menu at Eorlund Gray-Mane in Whiterun and scroll through the menu. It could take a few seconds to a few minutes but it will CTD randomly.<br/>
<br/>
Going to request a crafting order from Eorlund Gray-Mane<br/>

[CTD]CTD trying to reload after dying outside Halted Stream Camp (SkyrimSE.exe+929E90)

<td class="description">Type of Bug: CTD<br/>

Two crashes on different characters after the same sort of thing occurring;<br/>

SECOND: https://pastebin.com/fXNmVASj<br/>

I clear out the camp then exit through the back, into the trap pit. I walk into something something (the second time it was the elk body, idk what happened the first time. The first time it happened I thought the remaining bandit killed me; she wasn&#39;t fighting anymore but I thought maybe she swung when I exited the mine.) and I ragdoll and die. When I reload (to a quicksave taken before exiting the cell, as I usually do. I think once it might have been a normal save but I&#39;m not sure) it crashes. When I reload again it seems fine. I haven&#39;t deliberately killed myself a second time after the crash.<br/>
<br/>
1. Enter Halted Stream camp mine.<br/>
2. Travel through the camp and save before exiting out the back.<br/>
3. Walk against a body or possibly other moveable object.<br/>
4. Get flung into the spikes, I think? Die.<br/>
5. Reload previous save.<br/>
6. Crash to desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Loading a save after dying. It shows the loading screen like normal, then freezes &amp; closes after a few moments.<br/>

[ENB] Strange water reflections
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">h2. *TerTerRus* *_—_* *Today at 1:20 AM*<br/>
<br/>
Do you know about water reflection at the border of the screen? its like cuts off? its easy to notice, and I remember loooong time ago maybe 8 or so years I had the same border cutting reflection edges - and some guy said its cause enb calculates screen space refections and u need to put some value which is larger then your screen to fix this (it was 8 years ago so I dont remember exactly but it worked\!\!\!) and the same stuff happened to me using enb&#39;s in Fallout4 -- some enb&#39;s have this weird reflection bug and some doesn&#39;t (each of them use reflection though in enb) I can show screenshot but its noticable in motion and not so much on static.<br/>
<br/>
[https://youtu.be/1g5eUnxqY0Y?t=529|https://youtu.be/1g5eUnxqY0Y?t=529|smart-link]here is timestamp of water - pay attention to right border of the screen - some weird interactions are happening right? and here is the answer why - bScreenSpaceReflectionEnabled=1 bScreenSpaceReflectionEnabled toggles screen-space reflections (SSR), a technique which uses screen-space ray-tracing to calculate accurate reflections on the surface of objects. Because of its screen-space nature, however, the effect will fade at the edges of the screen. SSRs are most noticeable on water or metallic clutter. It is recommended to leave them enabled, unless certain water mods cause things to look strange. ---- and we do have water mods that cause things to look strange - so if we turn it off ENB will do its job and everything would work correctly\! currently everyone using high and ultra presets should be experiencing this weird water gllitches on border of the screen<br/>

[Exploit]Some resurrected minions do not decay when they die

</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Exploit<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure, but I think it&#39;s somewhat related to Necromantic Empowerment on Target; I&#39;ve noticed that using Resurect II, III or IV on targets, sometimes they don&#39;t decay to dust, so I can resurrect them forever. It&#39;s true that this happens on targets I&#39;ve healed with Necro Emp, thus I think may be related, but I don&#39;t have the perk to avoid them from decayinf to dust. Right now, I&#39;m using both daedras of Mehrunes&#39; quest and I have just destroyed an Enchanted Sphere thanks to them... And if they die, puff, resurrect and keep rolling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Resurrect a creature using Resurrect II, III or IV (I don&#39;t have higher yet), I perked Conj up to level 50 although I&#39;m pretty sure it was happening before too. Whenever you minion is damaged, heal it with Necromantic Emp on Target; when it dies its body should remain.<br/>

[Exploit]Still free loot in Nortwatch Harbor location (after 1.1.6 Hotfix)

<td class="description">Type of Bug: Exploit<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I report this issue because in the 1.1.6 changelog it is assumed to be solved (WL-1457). In Nortwatch Harbor location (probably added by Better Docks), every chest, every strongbox and every item in general is still totally free-to-loot (despite the Thalmor guards). I have collected about 3000 coins, plus a lot of gems and some magical items. It is a location very close to a possible spawn point with a random &quot;in the wilds&quot; start.<br/>

[Functionality] Skeletons can loot weapons from dead allies, which can break their ability to launch attacks (if they grab an incompatible weapon, such as a dagger).
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">As per the summary, I noticed an unarmed skeleton archer (broken bow) loot an iron dagger from a nearby dead mage. After drawing the dagger, it floats between the skeleton’s feet and it will no longer use it’s unarmed attacks. The player does not take any damage at this point, indicating that there are no attack events firing at all. Some example steps to reproduce: <br/>
<br/>
1. Input {{coc FortSnowhawk01}} into the console. <br/>
2. Upon loading, turn around and head out through the door. <br/>
3. Kill all of the mages and skeletons outside, bar one. <br/>
4. Break the last skeleton’s bow <br/>
5. Lead the skeleton over to a dead mage <br/>
6. Allow the skeleton to loot the mage’s dagger (they all seem to have one). <br/>
<br/>
RESULT <br/>
As described above, the skeleton will be unable to launch any attacks in this state. <br/>

</td>
<td class="description">*Summary Of Bug Encountered*<br/>
Possible dialogue bug with Brynjolf: during the Main Quest Delphine directs you to ask Brynjolf about Esbern. He&#39;s supposed to have the dialogue option regardless of whether you&#39;re a member of the TG, and if you&#39;re not a member you can use Persuade checks to get him to tell you, or tell you to bugger off if you don&#39;t have high enough Speechcraft. He didn&#39;t have the dialogue option when he was selling in the market nor after hours when he&#39;s in the Bee and Barb. This isn&#39;t game-breaking as the PC can still ask Keerava however, the dialogue should still be there. (Unless it&#39;s a Requiem thing.)<br/>
*Steps to reproduce:*<br/>
Advance MQ to &quot;A Cornered Rat&quot; (MQ202 10) and talk to Brynjolf without being a member of the TG.<br/>

When I eat mudcrab chowder I don&#39;t get the stamina restoration effect I&#39;m supposed to, even though eating other foods like rabbit mushroom stew work fine in the same conditions (same place and time).<br/>
I&#39;m almost 100% sure that it used to work at some point and then it stopped working, but I&#39;ve loaded a few older saves and I haven&#39;t been able to get it to work again.

**Detailed Description**<br/>
Issue casting thermal and night vision using the power key Z when selecting from the fav Q or manually selecting from the power menu using O. The default hotkey B &amp; N do not work for either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I gave myself both night and predator using the cheat menu. I have both in the favorites Q and I can cast night vision. However, when I do it disappears from the fav menu Q but is still selected as a fav in the power menu O. Furthermore, I cannot cast thermal at all. I get the out of magicka sound. Thermal is in favs, goes away when I try to cast, and is still selected as a fav in the power menu. When I switch back and forth using either fav Q or manual O, they swap appearing disappearing in fav Q. Meaning if one is visible in Q the other is not. I still have the same issue if I go into the power menu and try to cast thermal, rather than selecting from the fav using Q. To circumvent, I assigned a hotkey for each using NP2 and NP3 and this works. The bug only persists when using the power from the fav Q or selecting from power in the magic menu.<br/>

<td class="description">Type of Bug: Inns keepers shop<br/>
**Detailed Description**<br/>
Okay, this is sometimes really easy to pass by whitout noticing it especially since most players will think this is normal, on the first 3 days after your character was created the Inn keepers will have a much short storage for seling (the problem being, that this stock is fixed on them forever, even if you wait 10 days outside the cell after entering it or save and kill the vendor, that short stock will be forever on that save), the bannered mare for an example, if you start your game in there or enter the cell before 3 days have been passed Hulda will only sell 2 beef stews and 5 cabage soup, this happens with any other Inn keeper, if you visit the Inns before 3 days have been passed you will notice that they have 5-10 items at most for selling, take the winking skeever as another example, you can test this out with any character, start a character (disable sunhelm and frostfall to not die by hunger or cold) make a save and visit the two Inns mentioned, they will sell a very smal amount of food, save and kill them, or wait two whole weeks outside the city and talk to them again, they still gonna have that same small stock, now, go back to the first save made, wait 3 whole days and talk to them, they will have their immense (normal) stock, and every 3 days it will reset it.<br/>

The only way to get the poisons to apply is by going into the main inventory menu and applying them from there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Favourite a poison so that i appears in the SkyUI Favourites menu (that appears when pressing Q)<br/>
Click to apply the poison and confirm.<br/>
The poison will be used but its effect will not be applied to the bow<br/>

When you do the quest &quot;The Raid&quot;, Riften quest to clear the city of skooma dealers, you go into the warehouse and kill the smugglers for good.

<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
This issue doesnt happen in first person view. Only third person. Video will be provided showing the glitch. At first I had no problem with bound battleaxe. I played thru some content with it and my other spells with no issue. For unknown reasons, it just suddenly started. Then what I did is give up this specific build and i removeperk some twohanded and put em in onehanded and continued playing with dual bound swords which worked fine. Then a few levels later i tested the bound axe and now it worked fine.. so I reloaded the old save where the problem was happening.. and it was fine now. So I played a couple minutes, spawned a few battleaxes, killed stuff, then I spawned a spectral warhound and suddenly the problem started again. If I reload the game while the bugged spawned axe is in my hand, after the reload it appears and its fine. But if i try to spawn another, its the same problem. Maybe its the spectral warhound that breaks it but I cant reproduce it and besides, I played with those two skills before this started. This is all I can tell you.<br/>

I can reproduce this intermittently but not every time. When I open the Magic menu, the cost of any spell is X. If I then open the Skills menu, leave the menu, then go back to Magic the spell cost is ~X/2. The values are wildly different. I think this is a bug and not some nuance of game mechanics because when the magic menu says the cost of Healing Aura on Self is 66, I cannot afford it with a full magic pool of 140. If I open the Magic menu again, the cost will appear as 155 Magic, which exceeds my pool. This happens under any circumstances and in any location I&#39;ve tried.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect this is related to Heavy Armor perks not working quite right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
On a new character, get the first 4 HA perks. Get any Novice or Apprentice Destro or Resto spells. View spell costs in Magic menu and again after viewing the Skills menu. <br/>

<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay<br/>

When I tell a follower to stop using formations, they stop for the moment.But if I then command them to wait and then follow again (which I often do), they enter back into formation status, at which point I have to once again tell each one to ignore formations.This gets tedious quickly, especially because I have to tell each follower separately and there is no global toggle for formations.I just want to be able to make my follower(s) stop using formations until I tell them to use them again.<br/>
The attached clip shows me hiring a mercenary fresh off of a new game (latest version), and once they&#39;ve been placed into a formation, then wait/follow commands keep resetting their status back into formation, no matter how many times I tell them to ignore formations.<br/>

[Gameplay]Formations break follower AI and make them unusable
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
High Graphics<br/>
<br/>
Formations are completely broken.Please see the attached videos that showcase these issues.All the clips except for the one in Bleak Falls Barrow were taken right after starting a new game (v1.1.11) and hiring mercenaries, which I did to make sure that it&#39;s not just my current save that may have gone kaput.<br/>
<br/>
- Followers are exclusively and singularly focused on one task: to remain in their formation position, no matter what, even if they are taking hits until they die.<br/>
- Followers will not use their bows, ever, while in formation.Often times they equip their bow and keep drawing it over and over again, without ever firing.<br/>
- Most of the time followers will not engage the enemy even in close quarter melee combat.They just stand around soaking hits from the enemy.<br/>
- Followers will spam many health potions within 1 second<br/>
- Followers will not form the correct formation shape<br/>
<br/>
All these issues are intermittent but extremely frequent.Also, keep in mind my previous report where I pointed out that I have no way of turning off formations, which compounds the issues.(I can only tell each individual follower to ignore formations for a short time until I use the Wait/Follow command and they fall back into formation again, which is not practical and extremely tedious.I think the &quot;Formations&quot; hotkey menu should have an option to turn off formations for all followers permanently).<br/>
My followers are unusable at this point and I am forced to abandon them.<br/>
I wish there was a way to somehow disable formations permanently and never look back (console maybe?).My character build revolves around using followers and I would like to salvage it somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this follower system mod will be dropped for good, whether or not it gets replaced with a better one.Even vanilla follower AI is better than this.<br/>

Now about the bug: I am the owner of a monitor 16:10, with a resolution of 1920x1200, and faced with the following bug, which in no way can not solve myself: the wrong location of the interface elements on the screen. I&#39;m pretty sure that the problem is not from my side: I&#39;ve reinstalled the game and modpack several times, and finally solved the problem only when I changed my monitor to an older one with a 16:9 resolution. Apparently, the interface configuration for 1920x1200 resolution is simply missing. <br/>
<br/>
Separately, I note regarding the screenshot: it was not made by me, but it perfectly reflects what I see on the screen. I can not make my own screenshot for the aforementioned reasons - I have already changed my monitor and thus stopped the problem, but did not fix it. <br/>
<br/>
I can assume that the problem can be solved quite simply by manually specifying the coordinates of UI elements in Skyhud.txt, because that&#39;s where the settings get confused. <br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Try running Wildlander at 1920x1200 resolution? <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I would be very surprised if it turns out that the problem is exclusively on my side for some reason.<br/>

Clean install ran into the issue clean install again with the default character following wiki exactly. The camping MCM says to set as default to put it back in the spell&#39;s menu but there is no option to do so as they are already configured as bound keys (default I suppose) but taking it from the spell&#39;s menu.<br/>
<br/>
Experienced bug hunter for a lot of development but have since had a brain tumor removal so I may well be missing something but, don&#39;t think so. I have checked the wik,i github, and google searches looking for a fix. The one thing I have not tried is looking at the code behind the camping mod being used because I realize there may be other mods affecting this setting. Also stuck in the abandoned prison in the wiki trying to reach out other channels unavailable. <br/>

<br/>
While using/equipping a crossbow, the stealth meter disappeared, and then shortly afterwards the crosshair disappeared too.<br/>
<br/>
Reloading, or loading earlier saves, didn&#39;t fix it. Eventually I managed to get it to return temporarily by restarting and loading the very first save, before loading the current save. Worked for a while, but then disappeared again. One time, changing weapon from crossbow to sword made it come back, but this doesn&#39;t work every time.<br/>
<br/>
Now, sometimes the stealth meter flickers on and off randomly when not crouching. It seems stealth is triggering when this happens because guards follow me around.<br/>
<br/>
I think it might be a version of the SmoothCam bug mentioned here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252 because it&#39;s a known issue with mods that move HUD icons, and it seemed to be linked to using the crossbow initially.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m using a brand-new install of SSE, using no other mods, and until then had made no changes to MCM except to enable Sunhelm.<br/>
<br/>
My laptop is below minimum specs (Intel HD 620) which probably doesn&#39;t help<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
I&#39;m not sure exactly what triggered it in the first place unfortunately, and since all my saves have the same bug I can&#39;t now check what would trigger it. Possibly reloading the crossbow while sneaking, or equipping an unloaded crossbow.<br/>

[Gameplay]Unarmed range is too short to hit Falmer and Trolls
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
Ultra Graphics<br/>
<br/>
When fighting Falmer, Trolls, summoned Ghost Trolls, and probably other unshapely creatures, Unarmed strikes cannot hit the target if you&#39;re face-to-face (This is important).<br/>
<br/>
Attacking these creatures from behind, or while they are ragdolled/knocked down allows the punches to connect and properly damage the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be caused by weird Bethesda(TM) jank in regards to those particular enemies&#39; hitboxes and hurtboxes, and the problem arises with Requiem&#39;s changes to weapon reach. (A quick search suggests that Unarmed has lower reach than daggers)<br/>
<br/>
The only confirmation of the problem I found was this ancient Reddit post on the Requiem sub. <br/>
- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/4j63v4/cant_hit_trolls_and_falmers_in_front/<br/>
-<br/>
It describes the exact same problem I&#39;m experiencing, but I suppose the issue went overlooked by the Requiem developers due to how infrequently players attempt to use Unarmed.<br/>
<br/>
If it matters, I&#39;m playing a Khajiit Male, on the larger side of the size and height sliders.<br/>
<br/>

[Gameplay]Wooden Barrel/Wooden Chest can softlock all your controls
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
Ultra Graphics<br/>
<br/>
If you left-click a wooden barrel/wooden chest to enter it into spawning mode, but you press spacebar before it auto-closes your inventory gui, it places you into barrel/chest spawning mode like normal, but softlocks ALL your crucial keys. You cannot press E to open the gui to put the barrel/chest down nor cancel its placement. You cannot jump. You cannot move. You cannot access inventory. You cannot SAVE\! You cannot even hit escape to access the game&#39;s pause menu\! The only things I was able to do during this consistently repeated softlock were to turn my lantern on and off with L and use my mouse1 and mouse2 to draw my crossbow, fire it, and bash the ground I was standing on. <br/>
<br/>
The only way out of this softlock is to tab out, open task manager, and kill the game manually from there. <br/>
<br/>
How I found this glitch:<br/>
<br/>
I use my &#39;Wonderbarrel&#39;, as I call, it for tedious but infinite inventory space, and it&#39;s an absolutely crucial part of my playthrough as weight/inventory management is the biggest hurdle I face with my packrat playstyle. When spawning my Wonderbarrel though, I am almost always stuck inside a phantom version of it that locks my movement and I must jump to get out of this invisible barrel and move around to get a better placement, or sometimes as a mandatory fix just to get the &#39;Place Here&#39; prompt to actually show up on my screen. After LOTS of use with this janky barrel, I began to get into the groove of jumping right after I select the barrel to get unstuck from the phantom barrel placed inside me as the Wooden Barrel select-spawn-spot state is activated. I eventually got so comfortable with this annoying pattern that I did it too fast, and ended up hitting space before the barrel spawning mode state actually began. I lost 20 minutes of progress as I could not save or get out of this state. <br/>
(Side bug note on this: using the Wooden Barrel in an area with a low ceiling, such as the docks entrance to the Ratways in Riften can result in a different sort of softlock where the low ceiling somehow messes with the phantom barrel that makes the &#39;Place Here&#39; prompt appear at all and never shows up even though the teal placeholder barrel hologram is still visible and moving. This forces a reload or console commands to escape the spawning-mode player state because the &#39;Place Here&#39; prompt never shows up no matter which angle or movement keys you try.) <br/>
<br/>
No, but please for the love of God just cut out the middleman with mobile inventory items and ditch the janky buggy &quot;Place here&quot; system if at all possible. Just make these items open a container when clicked on from inventory... or better yet, just have them auto-placed inside of you and have no collisions so players/npcs can walk right through them but they still act as containers to be picked up and set down. I&#39;ve opened my Wonderbarrel hundreds of times by now, and the stupid &quot;Place here to make it a real object for extra immersion lol&quot; gimmick got so old so fast... if there&#39;s ANY better way to implement inventory-extension features like Wooden Chest/Wooden Barrel, I&#39;m begging you guys as a packrat player-type, put that somewhere on your priority list for the next or next-next major update. I am not sure but I think Deep Storage the Alteration spell is from Wintersun (or at least it&#39;s Legendary Edition predecessor variant), and was so sad to see it get beat out by religion expansion in the poll. I&#39;d take an annoying 5-second spell cast animation over my Wonderbarrel&#39;s horrific jank any day of the week. <br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Left-click on a Wooden Barrel or Wooden Chest item in your inventory, then immediately hit the spacebar. Make sure to do it fast enough that you hit space BEFORE your inventory window is force-closed by the Wooden Barrel spawn-in script(s). <br/>
<br/>
Works anywhere, not location-related, nor would screenshots of a teal barrel be very helpful. <br/>

<br/>
First, the porch door has two interactions that show up simultaneously from the outside depending one where you are looking at the door: one for when the player is residing in the house (&quot;Open Honeyside&quot;) and one for when the player is renting the house out (&quot;Examine Lock Rented House - Requires Key&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Second, the shelving right outside of the bath (when facing the bath) has a missing wall texture behind it. You can see through the bookcase into the boundless beyond. It is quite the sight but also a bit immersion breaking.<br/>

<td class="description">**Detailed Description** <br/>
<br/>
So unlike what I assume is thought, the horse isn&#39;t exactly spawning out of nowhere. The horse is getting instantly pulled from other nearby horses. So if you ride past a stable there&#39;s a chance the horses at the stable will spawn right on top of you. and then slowly walk back to where they spawned from (the stable). This does not create duplicate horses, it&#39;s as if they teleport to you. It is more of just a guess, but I&#39;m actually thinking this may be cause by suspiscious city guards, as I&#39;ve noticed several times that the horse&#39; spawn on me, a guard or two will come running right next to me. I think there may be a correlation. Ride your horse around the Riften Stables, around the house right next to the stables etc..

[Horse]Frost’s fancy armor disappears after entering whiterun 
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Horse<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
Ultra Graphics<br/>
<br/>
I loaded up my game, and the fancy armor that Frost comes with was missing. Naked horse. <br/>
<br/>
I loaded a few saves back to where the horse had armor, and I can go in and out of other places, and the horse still is wearing the armor when I come out. So I get back to Whiterun, WITH the armor, and I save game, looking at the armored horse. <br/>
<br/>
Save and load; still armored. Cool. <br/>
<br/>
Thinking maybe some script or something needed time to load into the game, I loaded the original game where Frost had become unarmored, and snack to naked. <br/>
<br/>
Here’s where it gets weird: I loaded the game with the armored Frost that I had just re-saved and verified while looking and saving, and the armor was now missing in *that* save as well, even though the save screen clearly has the horse in the armor. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, seems like a bug. I fiddled with it a bit by trying to put a cheap saddle on instead, but rather than swapping saddles/armors (giving me the option to see frosts equipped armor as an inventory item) it just “equipped” the cheap saddle, with Frost still looking heavily armored. When I unequip the cheap saddle, frost then becomes naked. <br/>
<br/>
That’s about as detailed as I can be, hopefully I explained it okay and it makes sense. In the grand scheme it’s no biggie, (considering frost is a rad horse, the quest isn’t *that* hard, and that armor is really expensive) but I thought the team might want to know. <br/>
<br/>
This reminds me a lot of what happens with Fallout 4 and Paladin Danse’s power armor being buggy. It t doesn’t show in his inventory, and if you try to put new armor on him it screws everything up, messing with his weight etc. apparently it counts as invisible armor in some unused armor slot that modders like to use. Anyway, just my 2¢<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Go get frost, race straight back to Whiterun, set up a camp right outside the first gate as closr where it’ll accept a tent/barrel/campfire, go into whiterun, sell a bunch of stuff to belethor, go back outside (look at the horse here, it may have already lost its armor at this step), save and quit. Load game and the armor should be gone. <br/>
<br/>
Not sure what I could screenshot that would be helpful.<br/>

<br/>
There is no way to properly disable the crosshair in 1st person view when using bows or magic - if deactivating it in the skyrim game settings, some mod brings back the crosshair after going 1st person - 3rd person - 1st person. If you go into the skyrim settings and activate - deactivate the crosshair again, it&#39;s gone. Not major, but if you want the increased immersion/difficulty of having to use the bow without crosshair, it&#39;s basically not possible without quirks at the moment. Thanks for everything you did to the game, it&#39;s wonderful, love you guys\!<br/>

[Items]Body wearing Master Destruction robes can sometimes fail to spawn inside Mehrunes Dagon Shrine
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay<br/>
**Detailed Description**<br/>
After clearing the shrine, I discovered that the body didn&#39;t spawn in place where it was supposed to. Reloading an older save prior to entering the shrine didn&#39;t fix it - restarting the game completely and loading an older save did, however. As far as I can tell, the bug does not occur all the time, and is rather inconsistent in nature, so the best solution would probably be relocating the robe directly into the dungeon chest.<br/>
<br/>
Complete the quest &quot;Pieces of the Past&quot; to gain access to the shrine. Go inside and look for the body, containing the robes (it should be to the right of the chest). <br/>

[NPC]NPCs unable to walk across a small area on Dawnstar boardwalk

<td class="description">Type of Bug: NPC<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
Low Graphics<br/>
<br/>
Right between Beitild&#39;s House and The Mortar and Pestle; somewhere along the boardwalk, rock and its close surroundings, there is a blind spot for the AI. Followers will not follow you through that area, and will sprint to enter the nearest building while you are in it. <br/>
<br/>
Some findings<br/>
- Followers seem to ignore the blind spot when they are in formation.<br/>
- This occurs for every follower in a group of followers, tried with up to three.<br/>
- If you go across the area by the boardwalk, followers will instead go all the way around and run aboard the ship in the middle.<br/>
- Captain Wayfinder can&#39;t find his way out of Silus Vesuius&#39; House, I&#39;m guessing due to his path going through this area and he instead runs inside the house. Verified by dialogue-porting him outside and shoving him across The Zone, after which he could successfully pathfind back to his ship.<br/>
- Guards will avoid this area as well, instead turning back and patrolling in the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Get a follower and go to Dawnstar.<br/>
Get to the lower part of town, where the water is.<br/>
Walk towards the Dawnstar Museum using the boardwalk. (keep an eye on your follower)<br/>
As you cross the path going to The Mortar and Pestle and approach Beitild&#39;s House, your follower will start sprinting towards the shop.<br/>
When you quickly leave &quot;The Zone&quot; from the other side, your follower will run all the way around and try to get on the ship.<br/>

One stood normally by the fire post closest to the room with the cooking pot and stairs. The duplicate is stood next to the original and looking/moving around in an agitated manner. You can talk to both normally. I think the duplicate is moving/looking to the side because he is trying to get to the first&#39;s idle marker. It&#39;s quite creepy.<br/>

<td class="description">Type of Bug: Purchaseable houses.<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
Ultra Graphics<br/>
<br/>
You need to buy all house upgrades at time of purchase. Thus about 27k for breeze home. Otherwise, certain doors in underground level may never function properly. Same goes for Riften&#39;s honeyside.. except in that case, you need to be prepared to reload if it glitches as well. For honeyside, buying upgrades in a std order (top to bottom) can result in glitches in house (invisible bed etc).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
This one is easy.. buy breezehome (27k) and/or honeyside (~22k).. Don&#39;t buy upgrades or only buy some of them and visit home. The underground floor will have some glitchy doors, etc.. that can never be used, even on reload. Thus, it&#39;s important to buy the upgrades (all) in a &quot;proper order&quot; and then go validate the home is setup glitch free. then save your game.<br/>

[Quest] &quot;Accept Jarl Balgruuf the Greater&#39;s surrender&quot; objective during Battle for Whiterun (Stormcloaks) is stuck.
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">*Detailed Description*<br/>
During Battle For Whiterun (Stormcloak version), upon defeating Bulgruf and Irileif, Balgruf is meant to surrender, and Vignar Grey-Mane should enter Dragonsreach, prompting an argument between the two men. In my case, Vignar walked in, and then immediately walked out and went about his day, causing the quest to break. Reloading the quest to when it started did not work.<br/>
<br/>
Using &#39;setstage CWSiegeObj 9000&#39;, I was able to complete the quest, but Ralof and Galmar kept following me, even after I used &#39;resetai&#39; on them. After reloading to the broken objective and using &#39;setstage CWSiegeObj 9000&#39; about 10-20 times to complete the quest, I was able to finally get them to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas discord moderators (understandably) believed this to be related to general CW jankiness, there are a couple things that point to this being an issue with the modlist.<br/>
<br/>
1. The unoficial Skyrim wiki lists the following objectives for the quest:<br/>
&quot;Objective 1000: Get your Orders from Galmar Stone-Fist<br/>
Objective 1005: Break through the Enemy Barricade<br/>
Objective 1015: Follow Galmar Stone-Fist<br/>
Objective 1020: Open the Exterior Gate<br/>
Objective 1030: Open the Drawbridge<br/>
Objective 1050: Enter Whiterun<br/>
Objective 1060: Break through the First Barricade<br/>
Objective 1070: Break through the Second Barricade<br/>
Objective 1080: Break through the Final Barricade<br/>
Objective 1200: Force Jarl Balgruuf the Greater to surrender<br/>
Objective 1210: Accept Jarl Balgruuf the Greater&#39;s surrender&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, running the command &#39;player.sqs CWSiegeObj&#39; (show quest objectives) shows most of these have been removed, despite still being present in terms of gameplay (i.e. they don&#39;t show in console, but you still need to do them, and all except 1210 worked fine for me).<br/>
<br/>
2. When looking at CWSiegeAttackObj/ CWSiegeObj (the quest) in SSEdit (formIDs 0004E857, 00096E71), I can see its being referenced by Wildlander.esp, challenging the discord moderator statement that &quot;Civil War isn&#39;t touched by Wildlander&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas there&#39;s a good chance the mods are correct, and this is genuinly just vanilla Skyrim being awful, I&#39;d suggest they be less dismissive of issues prior to investigating; this bug was gamebreaking, and took around 40 minutes to fix via console commands, and if it is caused by Wildlander changes, it should be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
N/A, from conversations with other users this appears to be intermittent. Sucks to investigate I know.<br/>

[UI] HUD is disappearing when drawing sword on horseback; appears to only happen when wielding a 1H + a spell

</td>
<td class="description">As reported by u/Kimber_EDC:<br/>
<br/>
{quote}I&#39;ve done some more research on this. The bug ONLY happens when you have a spell in one hand and weapon in the other and cast while the weapon is drawn. Bows and 2H weapons don&#39;t exhibit the problem and neither do 1H + shield/empty offhand. My character only has a couple of spells, so right now it&#39;s the summon wolf novice spell that&#39;s triggering it. May do some testing with other magic types tonight to make sure it&#39;s not just conjuration, but it&#39;s definitely reproducible for me like I described it.{quote}<br/>
<br/>
Maybe has something to do with the dual wielding blocking issue also experienced with spell + 1H?

[Visuals]Daedric Shield Floating in Mid-Air When Placed on Shield Rack

<td class="description">Type of Bug: Visuals<br/>
*Detailed Description*<br/>
High Graphics<br/>
<br/>
(Only tested in Breezehome so far,) Daedric shields appear in mid-air somewhere near the player when attempting to place it on a shield rack.<br/>
<br/>
The angle/location at which you place seems to make it appear in different places/orientations<br/>
<br/>
Images show two instances of player location when placed -&gt; location of shield<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use imgur often but the 1 link below should have all 4 images<br/>
<br/>
No other info comes to mind<br/>
*Additional Information*<br/>
Place a daedric shield on either of the racks in breezehome. Possibly other locations too, haven&#39;t tested myself<br/>

Normally, if you have an Iron Woodcutting Axe in your inventory, it displays on Campfire&#39;s fur backpacks.

Can&#39;t transfer items to horse after using Horse Inventory hotkey on controller.
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">*Detailed Description*<br/>
If you use the horse inventory hotkey, you will not be able to switch tabs to the player&#39;s inventory when using a controller and thus cannot transfer items to said horse using the controller. Using the default binding of left alt will work, so this bug is most likely just due to the lack of a specified key binding for the controller. To re-iterate, only the controller cannot switch to the player&#39;s inventory and vice versa. The keyboard can switch inventories just fine. If you don&#39;t use the horse inventory hot key and interact with the horse whilst sneaking to access the menu, and then use that to access the inventory, switching tabs on the controller will work. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Play on any character, use horse inventory hotkey and press the switch tabs button on controller. This is normally the same button used for wait time. <br/>

<td class="description">Certain equipment don&#39;t seem to be affected by Durability mod. The culprit seems to be equipment added by another mod(?), which adds equipment commonly described with a color, for example, I&#39;ve currently got two such items: &quot;Steel Gauntlets - White&quot; and &quot;Nordic Chestplate - Black&quot;, they do not have a durability number. They seem to be well balanced stat-wise, but they are just not affected by Durability. I will send screenshot which proves this.<br/>
<br/>
*Steps to reproduce:*<br/>
<br/>
Just grab one of them and confirm that they come without durability.<br/>

Doubling or even tripling the shrine blessings

</td>
<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay (E.g objects which cannot be activated or other game play related bugs)<br/>
**Detailed Description**<br/>
Randomly (no idea what could cause it except for the usual bathing suspect) my char would get double or in one specific case even triple shrine blessing. Last time this happened with shrine of Julianos I believe (the one which gives additional magicka), where I ended up having triple Julianos effects active which raised my magicka up by 100 points. Same happened with blessing of Kynareth (Whiterun temple of kynareth), which at one point gave me double the stamina buff (doubled effect) - if I recall correctly same happened once with blessing of Mara as well. The fix was to pick up another blessing from a different shrine, which would in turn reset the effects. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No known steps of reproducing, perhaps bathing does this after using it for a while because of the unequip/equip script, but don&#39;t take my word for it.<br/>

Flickering textures on low preset
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">*Summary Of Bug Encountered*<br/>
<br/>
I was on medium textures and low shaders. Then changed to low textures and kept low shaders. Now buildings and trees (mainly but probably more) textures are flickering. Its like they get fully illuminated for 1ms and then back to normal, and this rapidly flickers between one another. I tried making a new character (after restarting the game) and I spawned in Falkreath, issue is still there. Loaded back my old characters older save in Dawnstar and then it was fine. So I travelled to Whiterun where the issue first happened. On this same character. Now the issue is back again, but it seems less bad but still noticable.<br/>
<br/>
*Steps to reproduce:*<br/>
<br/>
After happening once it seems to happen in the same location, regardless of restart or new character. Dont have time to try out more today but will surely try switching back to other profiles so feel free to reach out about that\!<br/>

Forced Brawls (Various)
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">*Summary Of Bug Encountered*<br/>
<br/>
I have encountered three bugs all related to forced brawls (for example the thief quest or if you brawl with Uthgerd the Unbroken, but it should work with any forced brawl). 1. On the start of the brawl, I dont equip my fist. I ALWAYS equip a torch in the left hand and whatever I had in my right hand. (The UI shows fists for some reason). 2. Brawls, that end with opponents health bar at 1/4, for example thiefes guild quest, trigger a bounty with the first hit after the fight. Their is no save zone, where you can still savely hit the other guy (since at least I smash my left button). 3. This bug I can&#39;t reliable reproduce, but fights end somewhat reguarly without actually bringing results. Either the other opponent doesnt acknowledge the win or the quest gets stuck.<br/>
<br/>
*Steps to reproduce:*<br/>
<br/>
The first bug is easy. Just start any brawl (the first that comes to my mind is with Uthgerd the Unbroken in Whiterun). Of course have a torch. The second bug is the start quest for the thieves guild the easiest way. Start the quest, threat one of the targets into a brawl. If you win the fight, the first hit will trigger a 500 bounty. It should be obivous that you can&#39;t end punching that fast. The third bug I dont know... maybe it happends while testing for the first two bugs.

Holidays Issues - Multiple
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">Used this Holiday Guide for reference on actual in-game actions: [https://sites.google.com/view/isokumods/holidays/holiday-guide|https://sites.google.com/view/isokumods/holidays/holiday-guide|smart-link] <br/>
Most testing was done in Whiterun<br/>
Anything noted on the above site or in an in-game notice that states &quot;free healing in Temples&quot; simply requires that you stand close to the priest/priestess as they are casting. There is no dialogue.<br/>
Not all holidays have decorations.<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Harvest&#39;s End - Decorations appeared as normal.<br/>
<br/>
Tales and Tallows - Did not get an in-game notice, but probably because my timescale was sped up. Festivities proceeded as normal.<br/>
<br/>
Witches Festival - Got a map with X&#39;s in unmarked locations where witches are supposed to gather, but I couldn&#39;t find any witches<br/>
<br/>
Warrior&#39;s Festival - Combat dummies that appear for the celebration do not provide skill ups. Prices at smith&#39;s are half off.<br/>
<br/>
North Wind&#39;s Prayer - Merchants did not close up shop early and go to the Temple<br/>
<br/>
Saturalia - Outdoor celebrations appeared as normal<br/>
<br/>
Old Life Festival - outdoor celebrations appeared as normal, vanilla merchants did not close up early, some NPCs are supposed to wear white bandanas but I didn&#39;t see any<br/>
<br/>
New Life Festival - merchants closed and most were in the inn, no outdoor celebrations, Farengar clapped aggressively in Hulda&#39;s face, it was wild\!<br/>
*At some point during this while I was waiting to pass time, Fralia Gray-Mane died and was found in a gutter. Too much partying?<br/>
*Saturalia Decoration Season is not an official holiday, but lights and decorations are in the city from Evening Star 17th to Morning Star 7th, per description<br/>
<br/>
South Wind&#39;s Prayer - Did not see NPCs in temples. Only Belethor and Ulfberth closed early and went to Temple. Adrienne was still outside and could purchase from her<br/>
*Lucky Coins are available on the table with the shrine.<br/>
<br/>
Festival of Lights (Dawnstar only) - appears as expected<br/>
<br/>
Feast of the Dead (Windhelm only) - Names did not start to be read at 7pm. I exited the Palace of Kings, immediately reentered, and someone was in the process of reading names at approximately 7:30pm. Not sure if it was just delayed or if I needed to re-enter the cell. I also have no idea if he actually read 500 names. Free food and drink were available. The carriage driver and boat captains were not at their stations, and boat captains were inside the Palace, but I couldn&#39;t find the carriage driver.<br/>
*I need to test with a beast race and Dunmer, as they are not supposed to be allowed inside the Palace during this.<br/>
<br/>
Heart&#39;s Day - Inn rooms are free this day. Do not expect your free bed to be empty.<br/>
*Assumption is that ownership is temporarily removed from the bed allowing anyone to sleep in it.<br/>
<br/>
First Planting - Supposed to receive free healings at the Temple but Danica and the Acolyte maintained their usual schedules. Few NPCs in the Temple.<br/>
<br/>
Jester&#39;s Day - Functions as intended. Louis Letrusch in Riften did follow me for most of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Second Planting - Some vanilla merchants (Belethor and Ulfberth) close up early but the Temple was nearly empty after 5pm and Danica was in the market.<br/>
<br/>
Mid-year Celebrations - Did not get a note. (Showed up when I checked the mailbox for Merchant&#39;s Festival.) Did not see many NPCs inside the Temple. Ulfberth and Anorieth were the only vanilla merchants to close up early.<br/>
*Decorations remained up from the 14th through the 17th as they should.<br/>
<br/>
Merchant&#39;s Festival - Not sure if outdoor merchants sell for 50% off. Did see more NPCs inside shops than usual.<br/>
Sun&#39;s Rest - All shops closed, including modded. Free food and drink. Fireworks went off as expected.

Honed Metal occasionally doesn&#39;t restore player smithing skill to proper value, producing permanent debuffs (or buff?)

<br/>
Lizzy’s thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
{quote}basically when you talk to a smith who has lower skill than you - and try to get them to &quot;do&quot; something - it lowers your skill to match theres.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes - it doesnt clear that when you exit<br/>
<br/>
the person i seen it happen to went to Adrienne for some tempering - they had 90 skill - and it dropped theirs to match hers. After they collected the item from her - they noticed they&#39;d &quot;lost&quot; 60 skill<br/>
<br/>
pretty sure its hm_actor.psc and somthing for whatever reaosn doesnt call modifySkillLevel on exit of honed metal to reset the players skill <br/>
<br/>
there might be a reset in the MCM somewhere to handle it - but i havent had time to go take a look{quote}

Hunterborn isnt properly passing the amount of time that it supposed to - more details inside
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">*Summary Of Bug Encountered*<br/>
<br/>
I believe Hunterborn isnt properly passing the amount of time that it suppose to when you level it up and get better at it. I noticed this when I was skinning close to night time, where in the 10 mins it took me to field dress and then 10 mins to harvest an animal. It suddenly changed from early dusk to heavy night. Also reloading a save after the skinning/harvesting, fixed the issue and it was normal again when I reloaded.<br/>
<br/>
*Steps to reproduce:*<br/>
<br/>
just skin or harvest and check to see the weather or time pass by, even if it takes you 10 mins due to better proficiency, you seem to pass by alot more time via weather changes or nightfall happens way too fast.

I gave my follower Marcurio 2 scrolls of Summon Fire Atronach and 2 Scrolls of Summon Wolf Familiar (Ghost wolf w/e its called) and he is able to summon either (one at a time) infinitely during battle. In other words, he never consumes the scrolls.

<br/>
# Give Marcurio summon Fire atronach scrolls and record the amount you gave him (i.e. 2) 2. Go into battle and let him summon one (he doesn&#39;t always summon so this can be whack) 3. Check his inventory after the battle and see if he still has the same number of scrolls.<br/>

Infinite magicka
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">*Detailed Description*<br/>
I haven&#39;t tried recreating it anywhere else, but while training some destruction on the dummies behind the companions guild, I was using the basic lightning spell I started with (Sparks I think? Not sure) and found a way to continue casting even when empty on magicka by draining the bar fully then start recasting around half way filled. The bar will drain normally but I can continue casting even once its empty as long as I keep holding click. At the time I had the debuff from too much instant training and my magicka was lowered to about 75 or 50. As I said I haven&#39;t tried replicating with other spells or other training areas. If relevant I also have the apprentice stone on my character.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Use the instant training on a dummy until it says youre too exhausted and stopped training part way through, passing 0 hours<br/>
Start casting the spell on the dummy until your magicka is drained<br/>
Start recasting around half way full and enjoy infinite destruction training<br/>

<td class="description">**Detailed Description**<br/>
Lighting on the ground flickering on and off at night outside Atheron Residence when moving camera around. Also occurs on a patch of ground outside Sadri&#39;s Used Wares when walking around there. Also happens when walking up an alley away from Sadri&#39;s shop where three lanterns are hanging.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While checking the affected areas, you have to move backwards and forwards or move the camera around to achieve the light flickering effect.<br/>

Mage armor 5 does not take effect when mage armor 4 is being used. 
</p>
</td>
<td class="description">**Detailed Description**<br/>
This means that it essentially becomes useless since it has a short duration and long cast time, you will want to keep mage armor 4 up for the long duration, and use mage armor 5 before a tough fight. However, since mage armor 4 has a long duration by the time you have master spells, you cannot use mage armor 5, or you can&#39;t use mage armor 4. Essentially a master level spell is rendered fairly useless due to not either taking effect in addition to mage armor 4 or overriding it. I&#39;d say it should stack since it is a different type of effect, armor vs Phys immunity, but so long as it takes effect it would be fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cast mage armor 4 dual cast, cast mage armor 5, check active effects. I have the perk to increase mage armor if relevant, and the duration of alteration effects.<br/>

<td class="description">Type of Bug: Gameplay (E.g objects which cannot be activated or other game play related bugs)<br/>

Apparently randomly, my character would (happened twice already) get a stamina bug where I could run indefinitely with no stamina drain (apparently stamina regenerated faster then intended). Bear in mind this was without respite/powerful aura combo and no stamina regen gear - on top of that my char wears a necromancers amulet. A fix for this was to completely unequip my gear and hit the weight calculation reset under requiem settings. <br/>

<br/>
The big battles between the Empire and the stormcloaks seems to be quite buggy. Most of the time the fight is already won and the &quot;dead&quot; still animate like they were alive. But I can still loot them like they dead. And they dont seem to despawn. I was literally on the other side of the map and came 2 hours later back. Still there.<br/>
<br/>
*Steps to reproduce:*<br/>
<br/>
I dont know how you could find such a big civil war fight... But if you find it, the bugs apear themselves.

SB provides a fix to wards we’re not currently utilizing. SB page says:<br/>

{quote}*Accumulating Magnitude* (default: disabled)<br/>
<br/>
The maximum magnitude of an accumulating magnitude magic effect scales with its effectiveness, instead of the rate of accumulation.<br/>
Spoiler:  ShowThe base game scales the rate of accumulation of an accumulating magnitude magic effect with its effectiveness. Wards will for example charge 2.2 times as fast if they are dual casted. With this patch wards will instead have 2.2 times the maximum power if they are dual casted. The effectiveness of a magic effect is affected by dual casting, perk entry points, and resistances.{quote}
