# Leveling your Character

Once you have the basics of food/water/cleanliness/warmth and shelter covered. You can now focus on leveling your skills.
 
Wildlander is a deleveled world - The importance of understanding this can not be overrated, and people misunderstanding it are a constant source for the kind of question I'm trying to answer with this guide. A very common occurrence is people who think they understand the concept, and promptly ask, why they get their butt handed to them at bleak falls barrow when they try it at level 1. The answer is simply:-

{: .NoTitleGreen }
> If it kicks you in the teeth for the 20th time, it's above your paygrade. 

Confronted with this, a lot of people ask what they are supposed to do on Lv 1-5, then. The answer is: anything. Save often, try to run from a fight when you start losing, hunt, chop wood, collect ingredients and mix potions, mine ore, craft stuff. Anything. As long as it gets you gold and/or level-ups do it! Following on from that - Training your skills and armor.
 
## Damage Skills

For Melee , archers, or destruction mages - you can head to Whiterun and train on the training dummies at the Jorrvaskr in Whiterun, or to any town – most have dummies. Activate the Dummy and set how long you want to train for. Make sure you monitor your active effects and if you are too tired to train you won’t benefit from the experience. If you get too tired - sleep. 
 
## Magic

You can use the Research journal to research the spells you have equipped in your hands for “none offensive” spells e.g. conjuration’s spirit wolf. You will need a research journal in your inventory to do this. 

## Armor / Block

Running in armor will also slowly level it.  You can also use the time-honored requiem cheat of allowing slaughterfish to nibble on your toes.

For block you can either study a block book, or actually use the skill - head to a nearby mud crab and hide behind your shield.
 
## Camping

Every campfire you build and tent you pitch will level these skills up. The skills menu accessible when using a campfire will allow you to build a fire quicker in harsher environments. Upgrading a campfire to maximum will give you a 6 hour 5% XP gain buff - so you should do this first thing in the morning, and every time the buff expires.

Building a campfire and using the skills menu is how you allocate perks from the camping and sunhelm mods.
 
## Foraging

Using the skill will level this up. Higher levels are able to specify what to look for.
 
## Crafting 

Crafting is based on selling price, so anything crafted at a forge for low cost materiels, high sell price can level this. Smithing XP has diminishing returns so first craft will generate 3X base XP and second craft will generate 2X. You should always craft everything at least twice.

## Endureance

Run around in cold area's to passivly leave this up.

## Survival

When you get any of your needs to their max value, your survival skill will increase.

## Butchering

Processing dead animals levels this skill up.

# None combat methods of training

## Skill books.

Skill books in your inventory can be studied. These will give you training for however long you study for. 

## Research

Spell research journal will allow you to train up magic skills. Simply place a spell in either hand. Use the spell research journal. Select Research option. Wait for it to initialise, then you can either cast the spells or use the research book again to study them for a period of time.

Once you have finished research, activate journal again to exist research mode. Then find a bed to sleep away your fatigue (1 hour of study, 2 hours of sleep)

## Training dummies

You can "use" a training dummy to train with a wespon or spell equipted to train for a period of time. Then find a bed to sleep away your fatigue (1 hour of study, 2 hours of sleep)

# I’ve finished training - Now what?

Firstly - and always when in a major city - check the missive boards for quests which require “easy” kills (mudcrab, wolf or skeever parts are examples of such). You can also pick up quests for the easier item retrievals or dungeon cleans. Even if you’re not quite ready yet to take on the challenge or retrievals or clears you can pick them up as most don't have a time limit. 

Early on, scavenging from battles is an excellent way to get starter equipment, gold and smithing materials. If you run accross a big skermish between Imperials / Stormcloaks, stripsearch those battlefields and keep what you can use, disassemble or sell the rest.
 
The next section covers combat tactics in detail, but once you have a few levels and more importantly perks under your belt you can start to pick off wildlife. A good place to start killing is in the Whiterun sewers where the first few rooms contain level 1 and 2 mudcrabs and a few skeevers - Be careful about venturing too deeply as there are a few surprises lurking. Once you're comfortable with whiterun sewers, you can venture to Markarth, solitude or windhelm which also have sewer systems. If you don't want to go north yet - then you can pick off the mudcrabs around the whiterun area, but this is significantly more dangerous with level 10+ sabercats/bears also in the area.

Get a Crossbow, Aas fast as possible - make sure you are not in combat when you equip it, and load it to that its ready for use. Ideally you want one that doesn't break from damage - Dawnguard is a good example. Crossbows make short work of lots of the wildlife and bandits that will make your life a big problem.
 
After the wildlife has been beaten into submission, you are ready to tackle more intelligent competition in the form of the open world bandit camps. And after those, you can move into the bandit camp inside of dungeons - Helgen, Embershard mine and halted stream camp are recommended “Starter” dungeons for you to test your capabilities. 

In order of difficulty for starting content :-
* Animals 
* Bandits 
* Forsworn (unless Hagravens are present) 
* Draugr (unless Dragon priests are present)  
* Giant 
* Mage 
* Everything else.
 
The final advice regarding early dungeons is that you should not attempt bleak falls barrow or any other draugr areas without decent tempered ‘silver’ weapons and perks in both of your armor and weapon at skill- level 50 at bare minimum!
