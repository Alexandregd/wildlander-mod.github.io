Carry Weight is intentionally at a premium within Wildlander. 

While you will gradually gain carry weight with [Derived Attributes](..\6-MechanicsAnaylsis\DA.html) Obviously the canny adventurer needs some place to store his or her Ill gotten gains.

# Backpacks

Backpacks are the early game source of carry weight - they can be crafted (see crafting spreadsheet for requirements) or they can be purchased from general stores (rarely).

# Barrels and Chests

There are two variety of chests in the game - Camping chest/barrels - Crafted from player crafting - these can be picked up and placed with the "campfire" system anywhere which isn't settled.

The other type is a furniture item which was added to decorate your player homes and requires a Furniture workstation to craft. These workstations are in Riften or Windhelm warehouses or in your hearthfire home.

Campfire Chests
* Cannot be placed in cities
* Have linked Storage (multiple chests share the same inventory)
* can be picked up Easily by interacting with the chest.
* can be crafted anywhere.

Furniture chests
* Can be placed Anywhere
* Have separate storage 
* Require the use of Jaxon's positioner to move.
* Require a specific crafting work station


# Campfire Skills

There is a skill available at a player constructed campfire which increases your carry weight permanently. Press "<" to build a campfire, Increase it in size unstil the skills menu appears when interacting with it. 

Note: this skill requires a Skill point, earned from taking care of yourself and has two levels.

# Horses

Or as i prefer to call them, mobile storage. Each Horse has 600 carry weight and can easily carry most the supplies you need. You can even store your chest on the horse, making it have infinite storage.

# Faction Safe Storage

Containers in the faction (companions / Dark brotherhood / Thieves guild / Mage's college) which are marked with a "*" are safe storage. You can safely stash you loot here. All other containers should be considered unsafe and you will lose the contents if you reload a save, or the cell resets after 30 days of you not visiting.
