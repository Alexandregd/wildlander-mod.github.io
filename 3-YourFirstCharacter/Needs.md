## Clean

There are 4 stages of Dirt or blood. Your character will become dirtier every about 2 days, probably faster if you get into combat often. Getting hurt in combat has a small chance to make you advance a stage.

If you've reached stages 3 or 4 of the dirt/bloody level, you will get small buffs/debuffs to your speech related abilities (prices, persuasion, intimidation) as well as disease resistance. 

### Clean
You take your appearance seriously and those around you take notice. You are more likely to get a good price at shops, less likely to catch a disease and more likely to succeed when using your persuasion skills. (+5 Speech, +5% disease resistance)

### Dirty
You are slightly dirty, but still clean judging by the local standards.
You are somewhat dirty, but no more than the usual adventurer.
You are quite dirty. Your lack of hygiene can affect your persuasion skills. Time to take a swim? (-5 Speech, -5% disease resistance)
Dirt has been accumulating on you for a while. Merchants will dislike you and you will have a hard time persuading those around you. Your lack of hygiene also makes you more susceptible to disease. (-10 Speech, -10% disease resistance)

### Bloody
You have some blood on you, but nothing the locals are not used to.
You have some blood on you, but no more than your average adventurer. The locals will not pay attention to it.
You have blood all over you. You are no longer sure if it belongs to you or your enemies, but it certainly helps intimidating those around you. (-5 Speech, -5% disease resistance)
You are covered in blood and dirt. Although very intimidating, you'll have a hard time getting a good bargain or persuading anyone with your current appearance. (-10 Speech, -10% disease resistance)

To wash yourself, you only to find a small patch of water, like a pond, river, or lake. Almost all of the water in Skyrim will work, even if it's only foot deep. You simply need to stand in water and use a soap from your inventory (in the potion category) or press the keybind to take a bath. Your equipped items will be automatically unequipped and re-equipped after the animation has played. Taking a swim will wash most of the dirt and blood away. Standing in the rain also gets you clean, but it's not as effective as bathing properly.

### Baths in Inns

Bathing rooms have been added to all the vanilla inns in Skyrim and Solstheim. Each is its own cell, with a minimal footprint inside the inns – usually just a trapdoor and a small basket or other clutter to indicate the bathing room.  Exceptions are some inns that have a basement, like the Bee & Barb in Riften or the Nightgate Inn– the bath has a full door in the cellar. Or full door to the New Gnisis Cornerclub and the Retching Netch in Raven Rock. 

You must speak to the innkeeper to obtain the key to the bathroom. You will then have access to the bath for 12 game hours.

When using the bath, your player character will feel warmer & more relaxed. 

All soap baskets in Inn baths open a merchant container where you can buy some soap and sell yours.

### Soaps

7 types of soaps which are craftable through player crafting near the cooking pot :

* Plain Soap (Fortify Sneak +5)
* Blue mountain Soap (Regenerate health +5)
* Red mountain  Soap (Regenerate magicka +5)
* Purple mountain  Soap (Regenerate stamina +5)
* Superior mountain  Soap (Regenerate health +3, Regenerate magicka +3, Regenerate stamina +5)
* Lavender Soap (Fortify Speechcraft +3, Resist Magic +4)
* Dragon tongue (Fortify Speechcraft +3, Resist Fire +5)

Plain soap needs 1 Animal Fat, 1 Salt, All flowers soaps with the exception to Superior mountain, in addition to the plain soap requirements also needs 3 flowers of the type. Superior mountain needs 2 each of the 3 colors of mountain flowers.
