# Before moving your character
- Make sure you set up the “Q” Favorites menu with your weapon sets to make switching spells or ranged/melee weapons quickly. You can do this by Favoriting your spells/weapons and then, open the Q menu. Click the weapon and assign it a hotkey by pressing any number key up to '8'.
- Make sure to rebind your 'Fill' key in Sunhelm, and setup keybindings to your liking.
- Review the F11 keybindings.
