# Introduction

– The divines now also offer an empowered blessing for those in their favor. To obtain this blessing you usually have to solve the quest associated with their temple and/or fulfill some other conditions related to the god.

– Your crime record will now determine if the divines will bless you or not.

– The restoration perk tree now offers the perk “Painful Regrets” which can be taken without prerequisite nodes once your crime record passed the limits tolerated by the divines. By taking it you can get Cure Disease effect back, but the blessings are lost forever, once you lose them. To take this perk you need to have less than 30 items stolen or less than 3 murders or 3000-5999 lifetime bounty, and you need to have 0 current bounty. In such scenario it's much better to stock on cleansing potions, since Painful Regrets gives you some serious debuffs. The only exception is Nocturnal - she doesn't care if player is stealing or murdering, so her blessing should be available at all times.
