### 

## Hearthfire Homes

Once the main building or a wing has been constructed, an interior workbench can be used to furnish each room. Furnishings can be either bought directly from a steward or crafted using a wide variety of items. 

NOTE: You must leave your home for at least 30 days for the steward to decorate. Returning before this time will reset the timer.

** Expanded Cellar **
Choose from just one extra room or a hallway leading to two other wings. With a choice of 5 different room designs, and more still to come, there's definitely one to suit every playthrough:
- Main hall with desk, shelves and a choice of alchemy lab or arcane enchanter
- Brewery with brewers and barrels (North wing)
- Torture chamber with racks, shackles and cages (North wing)
- Vampire lair with thralls and a hireable thrall master to manage the operation (South wing)
- Training room with archery targets, training dummies and some trophy and display cases (South wing)
And if you can't find the perfect option, remember you can always design the rooms yourself by placing furniture manually!

If you'd rather use the extended cellar from a different mod, or if you're using a mod that extends the cellar and you're worried about conflicts, read the instructions at the bottom of the description. This is very easy to fix.

**Apiaries**
Apiaries are no longer a container. They can be harvested once a day for honey. Once you've taken the honey, you can harvest them again for some honeycomb or maybe some bees. You only need to take the honey for the respawn timer to start. If you go near an apiary you'll hear the buzzing of bees, and you may see some flying around too.

All of the Hearthfire homes can now have an apiary. Lakeview Manor gets an extra two as its bonus.

**Butter churns**
Butter churns now convert milk into butter. Because that's how they work in real life. Not sure what the plant thing was about...

**Cows**
You can now milk cows. Just walk up to one and press 'activate'. You'll probably need this feature if you want to keep using your new butter churn. Painted cows and dead cows can't be milked.

**Brewing**
Those useless mead barrels in your basement finally have a purpose. You can brew ale and mead in them, including many of the mead variants. 

**Windmills**
All of the Hearthfire homes can now have a grain mill. Heljarchen Hall gets a full size windmill as its bonus. 

**Wells**
You can now build a well at your Hearthfire home (Lakeview Manor and Heljarchen Hall only). This will allow you to use the well to fill your waterskins and bottles.


### Lakeside - Falkreath

<dl>
  <dt>How to Obtain </dt>
  <dd>A Letter from the Jarl of Falkreath will be delivered when reaching level 9 and clearing a bandit camp. This letter outlines that the position of Thane is available and with it comes the perks of buying a choice parcel of land in Falkreath hold.

The Jarl will require the following quests to be completed:

1. Rare Gifts – Bring Jarl Siddgeir a bottle of Black-Briar Mead. This quest option will not be available if one of the other Rare Gifts quests is currently active or if Dengeir of Stuhn is Jarl.
2. Kill the Bandit Leader – Part of a bounty quest.</dd>

### Heljarchen Hall - The Pale

<dl>
  <dt>How to Obtain </dt>
  <dd>Upon completion of the Daedric quest "Waking Nightmare" and radiant quest  "Kill the Giant," this site can be purchased from Skald the Elder in Dawnstar. If the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion during the Civil War questline, then Brina Merilis will offer it out of gratitude. Both will sell the property for 5,000</dd>
</dl>

### Windstad Manor  - HjaalMarch

<dl>
  <dt>How to Obtain </dt>
  <dd>Befriend 3 people in morthal Hold and then this site can be bought from the steward of Hjaalmarch at Highmoon Hall in Morthal for 5,000</dd>

## How to Decorate your homes.

Hearthfire Extended adds all the little things that really should have been part of the official DLC. It also adds some new, lore-friendly functionality to each homestead, perfectly integrated with Hearthfire's construction system. 
Hearthfire Extended allows you to build and place furniture anywhere, not just homesteads. Vanilla player homes and mod-added player homes can be customized too. Provided you have the Hearthfire DLC, this mod is perfect for any playthrough.

**Furniture crafting**
A special new carpenter's workbench allows you to make furniture that you can place anywhere. You can build this workbench in your basement, craft one at the regular workbench outside your homestead to place anywhere, or find one in the warehouses in Windhelm and Riften.

**Placing Furnature**
This requires the use of a mod included in the pack called Jaxon's positioner.

Once you use the item from your inventory, it becomes placed in the world at your feet. 

You can use the following image as a guide for the controls to move items to where you want them.
