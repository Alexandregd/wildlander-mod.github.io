_As the great quote goes: “Better be Safe than 15 hours in-sorry”_ 😝

_This guide has been created for new users in mind that want to stress test the stability of their game after downloading **base** Wildlander._

**Steps For Initial Stress Test**

1.  Start a New Game Skip through all the options.
1.  Open MCM Menu (press Escape, Scroll down to mod configuration)
1.  Find “Sunhelm” and **Disable**
1.  Find “Frostfall” and **Disable**
1.  Open Console by pressing '~' “Tilde” Key is below ESC*
1.  type: tgm   (Enter)  *  This Enables "The God Mode"
1.  player.setav speedmult 1200 (Enter) *This adjusts your characters speed*
1.  set timescale to 1000 (Enter) *This adjusts your worlds timescale*
1.  coc whiterun (Enter) *This teleports you to Whiterun*
1.  Your goal now is to run from Whiterun to Solitude Docks
    - You will get some stutter, maybe even a lot - that is fine. You just don't want to CTD.
    - Stay on the road the best you can while also trying to complete this as fast as you can
    - This may make you motion-sick - but this is Unavoidable as we are trying to force skyrim to load as much as possible
          as fast as possible.
1.  Run to Solitude Docks
1.  Once at the end of the docks (There is a _boat on your right_ ), spin and generally move around erratically
1.  If you do not experience any crashes during this process, your installation should be fine and you have a stable game - 

**Make sure to Exit and Restart Skyrim COMPLETELY before creating your first character to prevent script contaimination from the stability test.**


### I Crashed Jumping and Spinning at The Solitude Docks, Now What?
If you make it to Solitude Docks **but** crashed while there/spinning

     Test again with a lower ENB shader
         
### I Crashed On The Way To Solitude!
Your Wildlander graphics settings are too high!

     Test again with a lower Graphics preset

**Congratulations! You’ve finished the Stress Test!!** 🎉🎉🎉🎉
