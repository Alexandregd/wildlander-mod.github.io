## Frostfall Temperature Gauges

The **Center bar** represents your current exposure. As your exposure increases, the meter will fill up. The more full it is, the more penalties you suffer. Once it is full, you die. The glow around the center bar indicates you are currently warm from standing near a fire.

The **white line** is the maximum exposure indicator. This is the highest your exposure will increase to in that area. If the indicator is all the way on the other side of the meter, that means that the area has lethal (maximum) exposure. If your exposure is currently higher than the indicator, your exposure will decrease to meet it as you warm up.

The **thin bar** at the top indicates how warm your surroundings are.

The **thin blue bar at the bottom** is the wetness meter. As you get wetter, it will increase. As you dry off, it will decrease. Being wet increases the rate your center bar fills up.


## Sunhelm needs icons

Next to Frostfall indicators are 3 icons which appear “more solid” the more Hungry/Tired/Thirsty you are.
