This Page was intended to be a reference guide to enable the player to be able to work out how the heck to kill some things in wildlander. It Kinda grew from there to include all sorts of reference materiel from Requiem so that players wouldnt have to go look up a billion & one perks, spells and the like to work out what the enemies were shooting at them. 

This guide is broken up into several sections - The resistances used by enemies and, how those resistances are applied. The diseases that enemies carry, the weapons and damage types and the like.  Bandits / Mages / Forsworn / Necromancers will not be covered in the guide (with the exception to the Named Unique bosses) as there are far to many varieties to list, all of which have different perks, weapons, armor. The next section contains reference material to identify weaknesses of the armor specific human type enemies can do and the weapons they use.

Vampires Will be covered, but not in-depth as like bandits they have a lot of variations of Armor, weapons and base stats.

Ghosts and Dragur will only be in summary form for the various types. They will not have detailed breakdowns as various types of these NPC all look the same, but have differing stats. 

The final section of this page contains links to the various enemy types in the game, broken by their type. 

## Mass Effect

The weight of your currently equipped gear has a significant impact on many things you do. It affects mobility, spellcasting and combat effectiveness. (Requiem manual p122 Located in Mods\Requiem \Documentation)

Mass effect isn't directly linked to the type of armor you are wearing, but rather its weight. Your weapon is also taken in account. 

What you need to remember :

High mass (wearing HA most of the time) cons :
* Less movement speed
* Higher casting cost
* Higher stamina cost for attack
* noise, it makes sneaking harder (but not impossible)

High mass pros :
* better resistance to stagger and knockback effect
* better chance to trigger stagger and knockback effect on enemies. Bullrushing mechanics is your friend.
* high level of AR ('cause you are wearing heavier armor)



## Resistances List

List of basic resistances used in Skyrim.
|Type 	|	Cap|
|--|--|
|Damage (Armor Rating)| 	 	80%
|Poison| 	 	90%
|Fire  |	 	90%
|Frost |	 	90%
|Shock |	 	90%
|Magic |	 	90%

About AR (Armor Resistance) Values
  -  1 point reduces incoming physical damage by 0.1%. So 800 AR will reach the 80% cap when not considering Armor Penetration.
  -  1 point of Armor Penetration (AP) effectively reduces target AR by 1%. This means striking target with 500 AR with 10 AP makes the effective AR 450, making the target take 45% reduced damage not 50%.
  -  The AR cap applies after applying AP.

About AP (Armor Penetration) Values
Melee attacks and ranged attacks can penetrate armor, which reduces the effective armor rating and thus damage reduction of the target.

- Per point of armor penetration will bypass 1% of the target's armor rating with ranged attacks and melee power attacks. Standard melee attacks will bypass 0.5% of the target's armor rating per point of armor penetration. The maximum which can be bypassed at most 80% of the target's armor rating. 

- In ranged combat the ammunition used plays a key role for armor penetration. You can see the arrow guide [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xp1LE79R4uHC2yP7KkA2p1sS-l_TkaRAQfdHV4t0aOM/edit#gid=0)

About Magic/Elemental Resistances Values.
- Magic Resistance protects against all magic damage including elemental magic such as fire, frost and Shock .
- The effect of magic resistance is  multiplicative when combined with elemental resistance. Let's say you have 90% magic and fire resist. This will mean that you only receive (100%-90%) * (100%-90%)= (10% * 10%) = 1% fire damage, which is equal to 99% fire resistance. This also means that your effective resistences raises exponentialy as your resistance %'s become higher.
- Magic resistance protects you from Shouts, Fears and other none elemental spells E.g those in the illusion tree. 
- Unlike Vanilla, NPC's can have both elemental resistance and magic resistances.

## Humanoid Enemies 

For enemies wearing standard armor, and therefore with standard resistances you can check the armor guide [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMVLVouumU45jFfmjmWUVjTYY7_wLnrxwmHMi24R9OU/edit?usp=sharing) 

For enemies weapons and arrows you can check the weapon guide [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xp1LE79R4uHC2yP7KkA2p1sS-l_TkaRAQfdHV4t0aOM/edit#gid=0)

For the Afflicted, the only difference between a Bandit and them is the addition of the Poisonous Breath ability - This brutally painful poison deals 50 damage for 2 seconds.
