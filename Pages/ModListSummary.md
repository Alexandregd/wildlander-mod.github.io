# Mod List Summary

**As the List contains twice as many mods as the original Legendary Edition list, I will only be summarizing the gameplay and functionality mods in this section. A full list containing both the summarized mods below, plus of all of the audio, graphical, utility and bug related fixes are located [here](https://github.com/Wildlander-mod/Support/wiki/V1.1.0).**


## Core Mods

Wildlander is built around[ Requiem - the Roleplaying Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888). Requiem completely retools all of Skyrim to create a challenging, deleveled world with plenty of meaningful choices. It can be a bit obtuse, so I highly recommend reading up on it. [Requiem - Minor Arcana SSE Convert](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25843) tweaks many aspects of the game to provide a more consistent experience. [Requiem - Dragonborn Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34829) applies Requiem’s overhauls to the Dragonborn DLC.

[Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962) skips the main quest up to right before you’re called by the Graybeards, and offers plenty of pre-start options (found under the Wildlander menu), such as where to start the game and whether or not your character is actually Dragonborn.

[Diverse Character Creation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2573) is a character creation system that aims to bring the ideologies of Skyrim, Morrowind, and Oblivion together as one cohesive system. DCC introduces the ability to create characters with asymmetric skill levels and start with different (or no) spells based on your skills.

Wildlander SE – The one mod which ties everything together.


## Combat Mods

Requiem already makes significant changes to enemies and combat, and Wildlander ups that ante by adding [Wildcat - Combat of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1368) and [Mortal Enemies SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4881). Enemies are smarter, more aggressive, and more dangerous, but also fairer, as they no longer have undodgeable aimbot attacks or a suicidal drive to kill you at all costs.

[Realistic AI Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345) improves the balance and realism of sneaking and [Suspicious City Guards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38762) mean guards will become suspicious and follow you when they see you sneaking around.

To get a few levels at the start of the game you can use [Train and Study](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83432) – Hit dummies and read some books to train yourself over several hours of fast-wait time.

[Pumping Iron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13434) gives your character more muscles over time as your character’s combat- and crafting-related skills increase.

[Non-Exploitable Crossbow Reloading SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29869) prevents the player from using the old “switch weapons to instantly reload” trick. [Make Non-Exploitable Crossbow Slow Again For Requiem SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33140) makes the corrected crossbows match Requiem crossbow reload speed. 

[zxlice hitStop SSE - Script Free](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42811) makes you feel like you really hit something when the enemy gets hit.


## Survival Mods

Wildlander contains many elements of wilderness survival.[ Sunhelm Survival](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) adds the need to eat, drink and sleep,[ Frostfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/671) ([guide](https://skyrimsurvival.com/home/frostfall/how-to-play/)) adds cold weather mechanics,[ Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) ([guide](https://skyrimsurvival.com/home/campfire/)) adds the ability to camp outdoors to sleep, cook and keep warm, and[ Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900) (guides included in mod folder) adds mechanics centered around butchering animals.

[KN Cutting Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28715) gives you the ability to harvest trees for firewood by attacking with a axe  while [Dynamic Things Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49250) allows you to loot clutter objects and more, and[ Keep It Clean](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17846) and[ Dirt and Blood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38886) makes you stay clean to avoid disease and other penalties.

[High Hrothgar Kitchen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28323) adds an extra room connecting the High Hrothgar monastery to a small natural cave under the mountainside. This is the Greybeards' kitchen, where they store their food supplies and cook their meals. A spring at the back of the cave serves as a water source.


## Crafting Mods

Many new items and crafting options are added, with a crafting system built around[ Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608), [Simple Bedrolls and Supplies - for Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74027),  [Craftable Horse Barding More Saddles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23679), and [Winter Is Coming SSE - Cloaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4933)

[Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12885) allows you to contract smiths and enchanters to do crafting for you. Wildlander also includes[ ClothingCraft Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23207) and adds the ability to use the Honed Metal system to order clothes from tailors, which includes most alchemists.

[Item Durability](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42544) makes your weapons and armor lose their tempering as you use them, so you will want to re-temper them every now and then.

 
## UI

A combination of[ SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604),[ SkyHud](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12440),[More HUD SE A Matter of Time Iequip](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12688) and a smattering of other mods gives Wildlander a clean GUI that adds a lot of relevant information while removing certain things that tend to leave the player staring at the interface instead of experiencing the game world such as quest markers. The compass has had a much needed tweak to[ Remove Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30749)

The Map has been replaced with[ A Quality World Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5804)

Skyui also has plugins for[ Favorite Things](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27177),[ Inventory Functions SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13366),  [SkyUI AIO Survival (SAS)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17601), and[ Wider MCM Menu for SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22825)

[SSE Display Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705) All-in-one solution for smooth FPS-unlocked gameplay. Includes a physics fix, borderless fullscreen performance boost, refresh rate control, highly configurable frame rate limiting. [Notification Log SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27707) Captures your notifications so you can look at them later. [Convenient Dialogue UI - SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57943) adds Q.O.L changes to the dialog menu.

[Reflection - Level Up Messages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1188) Reflection brings back the level up messages found in previous Elder Scrolls titles. [Undiscover Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21471) prevents you from receiving discovered messages the first time you arrive at a new location. [Smaller Vanilla Cursors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20617) reduces the size of the cursor by 50%

For Normal use, Here is a quick rundown of what you’ll see:

The icons in the top right are ongoing magical effects, displayed by[ SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604). The blue and yellow bars in the bottom right are[ Frostfall indicators](http://skyrimsurvival.com/home/frostfall/how-to-play/). The apple, bottle, and moon icons in the bottom right indicate[ Sunhelm’s](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) survival needs and Keep it cleans Bath needs. The singular yellow bar close to the middle of the screen displays the remaining oil in your[ wearable lantern](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7560). The clock towards the bottom middle and date in the upper left are from[ A Matter of Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12937).

Finally, [Requiem - Less Double-Vision (R-LDV)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73666) reduces the drunk/illness effects so they don't actually make you want to be sick IRL.

## Economy

[Trade Routes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12358) alters the prices and availability of goods based on location and whether certain quests have been completed.

[Trade and Barter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081) increases buying and selling prices in big cities, as well as making a bunch of small price adjustments based on things like race and reputation.

[Realistic Trading Stocks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77680) gives the various fishers, woodcutters, etc. items to sell. It also lets you pay temple priests to give you long-lasting buffs.

[Skald's Mail - A Courier Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31791) replaces the courier system with mailboxes you can rent or purchase, and includes extra features such as mail-order deliveries from shops, shipping items long distances, and sending off gear to be improved.


## Crime

In Wildlander,[ the divines](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/wiki/divine_blessings) will disown you if you commit too many crimes, denying you the free disease curing and powerful blessings their shrines offer.

[Better Stealing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32295) allows you to steal items worth less than 50 gold without having them marked as stolen. It still counts as stealing as far as the divines are concerned, though.

The [Thieves’ Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) won’t let you in unless you’ve committed a certain number of crimes; see below for more information.


## Factions

The  College of Winterhold, and Thieves’ Guild all have prerequisites for joining and/or advancing. Check the MCM settings for [College of Winterhold Entry Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24749),[ Improved College Entry - Questline Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22184) and[ Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) for details.

[Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653) is a collection of tweaks, additions, fixes, and adjustments to College of Winterhold.

[Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514) is an expansion and overhaul for the College of Winterhold, including two new towers, a re-imagined Arcanaeum and Hall of the Elements, revised set dressing and clutter in many areas, changes that appear over time, door signs to assist with navigation, support for many other mods, and not a trace of hay.

[Choose Your Own Arch-Mage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30887) Why should the Psijic Order decide who should become the new Arch-Mage? It should be the choice of the current Arch-Mage. Unfortunately for Winterhold, that's you.

## Magic

The most significant change to magic (other than Requiem) is the inclusion of[ Spell Research](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20983). This mod is large and complex, so you’ll want to consult[ the guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mp0IQtb855bgCTCwjm7t3LDL52U3cC-2U_AF9qVu68E/preview) or this[ video guide](https://youtu.be/KDunu-3Q1Lc). The guide is for US 3.4, but the only thing that’s changed with Spell Research since then is the name of the liquids.

[Arctic - Frost Effects Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29817) Improved and realistic textures applied to frost spells and effects along with new 3D meshes!

[Deadly Spell Impacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12939) Fire, lightning, frost, and spit (Spider/Chaurus) spell impacts now have their own unique textures. This mod also increases the variation in impact size, increases the size of dragon breath impacts, and adds melted snow impacts for fire and lightning spells.[Voltage 4-2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15565)  Improved and realistic textures applied to Shock spells. 

[No More Ugly Effects SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16346) Replaces certain character effect shaders with an invisible version. No more garish green glow from Alteration armor spells! No more red/green/blue outline when using drain spells and effects.


## Transport

Fast travel is disabled by Requiem in Wildlander, so you’ll have to traverse the game world by other means.

[Immersive Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13402) adds many features, most importantly the ability to access your horse’s inventory and to call it whenever you’re outside. Owning a horse is very useful in Wildlander, as it allows you to travel the harsh roads in relative safety.

[Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) will add boats and carriages to settlements all over Skyrim and allows you to take them to almost any settlement.


## Followers

[FollowerLivePackage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33002) A framework which expands the followers functionality so they are actually useful!

[Disable Follower Collision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35925) disables collisions between the player and allied NPCs. Allied NPCs include followers, actors commanded by the player, and actors commanded by followers. 

[Follower Trap Safety](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2755) Disables the ability for followers to murder themselves by triggering traps.

These are designed to provide your characters with immersive areas in the cities, wilderness and sewers for rest, storage, and the occasional amenity.

If you get far enough into the game that you have a lot of player houses then you can use[ Rent My House](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49504) and put your unused houses to work by renting them out!

### Questing and Exploration

[Even Better Quest Objectives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159) enhances the quest descriptions in the vanilla game so that you have a clear sense of where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do besides looking at the quest markers. Let's face it - the quest descriptions were quite bad, not specifying where you are supposed to go by themselves, and forcing you to play with the quest markers on all the time.

In each major hold, there are now[ Missive](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) boards with a selection of radiant quests, like go kill this, deliver that or return item from a cave/ruin. These quests refresh every 3 days providing the MCM setup instructions have been followed.

[Underwater Treasure SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17267) Adds underwater treasure chests to discover all around Skyrim.


### Immersion

Nights and dungeons are very dark, and you won’t be able to effectively explore them without a light source. You can buy a lantern, use a spell or ability such as Candlelight or Night Eye, or for vampires and werewolves[ Predator Vision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2777), or use torches if you’re okay with occupying one of your hands.

Players are now able to interact with NPCs in multiple ways thanks to[ Immersive Speechcraft](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21296). Based on your character's speech skill, you might be able to convince an NPC to follow you for a bit, barter, help you in combat and more! [Realistic Conversations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1717) is a NPC overhaul which improves the npc’s conversation AI making them talk to each other and less likely to talk to you from a distance, while adding expressions and emotions to the conversations. [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187) makes friends talk to you more like friends. Followers have much more to say when speaking to them. If your spouse is a follower, he/she will talk to you like a spouse instead of a generic follower. NPCs who dislike you (not bandits and Forsworn, but citizens of towns and cities) will have more insults to say and may even completely stop talking to you if you continue to pester them.[ To Your Face SE and VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24720) NPCs will not speak greetings towards the Dragonborn's back.[ Guard Dialogue Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22075) adds dialogue, realism, and respect towards the player in the dialogue of Skyrim’s guards, making that dialogue much more immersive. Finally,[ No NPC Greetings (Special Edition)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1044) reduces the distance required for NPCs to greet you.

NPCs such as labourers now have[ real names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17827). Additionally, children are no longer[ immune](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46826) to the dangers of the world. [Hunters Not Bandits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1547) NPCs will not use taunts or insults when fighting animals. Especially hunters will behave in a more realistic manner, as well as fixing the odd behavior where enemies would start using greetings and other unfitting dialogues right after they killed you.

[GIST - Genuinely Intelligent Soul Trap SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15755) A new and improved solution to the underfilled soul gem problem.

You can now drop a torch to[ ignite the oil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13226) traps or sleep anywhere with [Simply Rest (or Sleep) Anywhere](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35618)

Inns and taverns have several games added such as[ blackjack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67050) and[ faro](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80275).

[Hold Border Banners](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1737) Adds banners along roads showing which hold you are about to enter.

Owning a house or a car in the real world would allow the government to tax you.[ Simple Taxes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14216) adds the same functionality to Skyrim for horses, followers, and player residences.

[Bibliophile's Arcanaeum - A Winterhold Circulating Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26772) This mod is for role-players and book lovers. It allows you to peruse the collection in the Arcanaeum, select books to borrow, curl up by the hearth, and be harassed by the college guard for forgetting to return them before the due date. If you wish, you may also study to add temporary buffs to your skill increase rate.

[Unlimited Bookshelves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2885) Lets you place as many books on a bookshelf as will fit, instead of a fixed number, as well as any other kind of item. Up to around 90 letter/note type books on a single shelf, and not limited to just books!

[R.A.S.S. Rain Ash And Snow Shaders - Wet Frost Cold Dust](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22780) and[ Cold Region Behavior - Beta Test](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38633) These mods reproduce the cold visual effects (cold breath, cold clothing, frozen effect, etc.) of “Wet and Cold”.
