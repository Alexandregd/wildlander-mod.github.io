# IEquip

iEquip is an antidote:-
- To the endless menu grind which pervades Skyrim, allowing you to switch weapons, spells, shouts, powers and other equipment on the fly, without menus to pause and interrupt gameplay.
- You can cycle and select ammo for an equipped ranged weapon, cycle through and consume potions, food and drink, apply poisons to equipped weapons, recharge your weapon enchantments and much more besides.

﻿In addition, iEquip comes with an arsenal of 'Quick' functions allowing you to quickly equip a ranged weapon, shield or ward if the situation calls for it, to quickly dual equip a spell, or to automatically select and consume regenerative or stat boosting potions as required. 

﻿And you can do all of this with just four main game play hotkeys, so you don't have to rely on a keyboard map or memorizing numerous hotkeys, which means gamepad players can also leverage the full suite of features iEquip offers.
